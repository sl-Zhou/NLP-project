      "['Afterall there will be an endless battle between the technology and human mentality.', 'Rising life expectancies can be a challenge.', 'People in current era are described as demanding or having high level of life expectancies in another word.', \"The surveillance is a useful method to keep society's safe, but also kills the privacy of people in some degree.\", \"And once this happens, privacy does not exist any more and people's life is under great threaten.\", 'So the rising life expectancies can be regarded as a proof of what we have made to combat for ourselves.', 'This would result in decrease in birth rate of a country which is a very serious problem,especially in more developed countries as the population has already reached a minimum.', 'Above all, the population aging will be a great challenge for the world for it drags the development of a society.', 'In modern world, many global issues have been appeared like global warming, concept of earth village and population.', 'It is a country without any freedom and democracy in the novel.', 'Large quantities of energy are needed for the pesticides, and to harvest and transport the food produces around the globe.', 'Therefore, we need to continue on our striving as try our best to reduce the adverse impact that is carried.', 'This already raises up a problem of privacy leakage.', 'However, ageing population is a phenomenon opposite to it.', 'What we can do now is to try hard to solve the problems and in the same time appreciate its great meanings.', 'In the United States, after the horrible attack on 11 September, the US congress passed the Patriot Act, which is mainly to increase domestic surveillance, to counter against the terrorists.', 'When a person grows old, the medical needs of a person increase over the years relative to the age of a person.', 'Since this is happen more often in the country which is much larger than Singapore, it is even harder or maybe it is impossible for the parents to find the child back without knowing where the child has been brought to.', 'There are kidnaps everywhere and not all of the family can afford the ransom that acquired by kidnappers.', 'With more perfect system with the old and more modern equipment, population ageing always comes first.', \"Thus, when a man with a 'terrorism tag' entering a junction or a plaza full of people police should notice this and observe the man's behavior as well as checking his package to prevent him from explode TNT.\", 'The observation means that the more developed the countries, the longer the life span of citizens.', 'Since RFID tags attached to the product can remain functional for a long period of time, it could be misused for surveillance purposed which are not related to the industries production or supply activities.', 'If our spiritual aspect of civilization cannot match our material aspect, old people will have a tough twilight years.', 'To sum up, with rising life expectancies, there exist both achievement and challenge.', 'Because that the birth rate is reduced while the death rate is also reduced, the percentage of the elderly is increased while that of the youth is decreased.', 'To conclude, the population ageing phenomenon indeed shows our big achievement on economy, medical skills and living standard.', 'All in all, the RFID system is used to catch the information of the object and track.', \"With the development of technology, we have more advanced method to track people in today's society.\", 'After they release from the prison, the movement of their whole life is controlled and known by the government.', 'When people start to age, many diseases will surface up un-noticing.', 'It is like a key that open up the gate of human body defend system and provide a cleared path for other disease to attack in.', 'Initially, surveillance technology such as RFID (radio-frequency identification) is implanted into the body of animals.', 'It is a break-through of technology and science, and an outstanding achievement of human wisdom.', \"With the development of technology, we have more advanced method to track people in today's society.\", 'The rising life expectancies may be due to several different reasons, for example, it may be because of the improvement of the living condition, or because of the upgrade of the cleanness of the living environment, or because of the wide arrange of nutrition that absorbed by the human, or because of the development of the medication system in the country.', 'Bad mood cannot give them a longer time of life.', 'Firstly, surveillance technology is useful in crime investigation and public issues.', 'In China, things like that will happen because the legal system is not sound enough.', 'In conclusion, what I have mentioned above, we have to agree, tracking system has many benefits in different parts in humans life especially in this modern world.', 'When surveillance technology like RFID brings lots of convenience to our life, some people argue that this kind of technology actually makes us feel unsafe.', 'Even our applications in our Iphones or other smartphones, our I-pad can easily revealed our locations.', 'They have a full control of their own lives.', 'People in current era are described as demanding or having high level of life expectancies in another word.', 'This would result in economic retardation and stagnation of a country.', 'Therefore the challenge is that we need to maintain or improve the state of living is a huge challenge.', 'But the primary labor force as well as the work force is from the youth.', 'Although surveillance technology should not be totally abandoned, regulations of using that is expected.', \"Many factories will be deserted and many companies will go bankruptcy, and thus people's life condition will definitely get worse.\", 'Now population aging is a trend.', 'Second, the shortage of workforce can also endanger the development of the society.', 'This will make the logistic process more effective and also prevent the occurrence of product lost because of the tracking.', 'Every coin has its two sides.', 'For these older people, the society need man power and all kinds of resources to provide a better life for them.', 'The biggest difference between human and animals or any other objects is that we have self-esteem or we need the basic respect from our peer.', 'It is well-known statistics that, generally, as a country develops the life expectancies increases.', 'Where every home houses an elderly, the future generations can learn and carry on their traditional and morale values.', 'There is needless to doubt that the medical technology has enhanced day by day.', 'It also indicates that the foods the people eat are nourishing and can decrease the amount of illness that can cause death, thus living longer.', 'However, the using of surveillance technology is usually done secretly, and a debate has been aroused today that whether surveillance technology should be abandoned.', 'According to article Lawful Interception, in US, every telecommunication companies have contract with FBI, requiring them to keep the phone call record easily searchable and accessible for FBI.', 'This ability is not seen 40 years back where the technology advances were not as good as now.', 'The challenge will be increase the quality of life while being environmentally sustainable.', 'The first type is just say the ID card which is carried externally by the person.', 'In economic, we can use GDP to explain the challenge, if GDP is low, it shows that most of people are living in a hard life, life quality is bad, then it will cause the terrible society problem, at last, it will happen the society disturbance.', 'In addition, it is also a challenge for government, family and parents to educate their children about the moral of filial.', 'In another a word, people will feel that the boss or the company treats them like goods, because modern people need more homage not money.', 'The rising life expectancies best prove these improvements and have definitely written a new chapter on the history human civilisation.', 'People are able to predicate some disasters like the earth quake and do the prevention beforehand.', 'Disabled people walks with artificial legs, man can getting pregnant, even the sexual of a human can be changed just by doing simple surgery.', 'This is the interpretation of challenge for rising life expectancies.', 'It is difficult to keep economy functioning well.', 'It is a progress of human being that we control the world and maintain our population with longer life expectancies, but it also has potential crisis for either nation or the human being.', 'Besides illness, the improvement of technology generates more food both in quantity and in quality.', 'According to news, the police force had mobilized thousand of cops, each of them prepared on duty and patrol in an allocated place all over the country and after few months, none of them was able to find Mat Selamat and rearrested him.', 'People fell into panic when they knew that they had lost the harmony and peace in their country and the government had no choice but keep claiming that their country is still in safety mode.', \"This clearly illustrates how a corrupted government may breach its civilians' privacy.\", 'Technology can be a very useful tool if being used in the correct manner.', 'More variation of medical needs was required to help increase the life expectancy of any human.', 'Furthermore, thanks to the development of technology, that the birth rate is increasing while the death rate is decreasing accelerates population aging and increasing.', 'In addition, field journeys are sometimes very dangerous.', 'In some fields, Surveillance technology did have brought us tremendous benefit and advantage.', 'Without life, we have nothing.', 'However, as the life expectancy of people rises, population ageing problem becomes more and more severe as a global phenomenon.', 'It is proud to have the ageing population which is hard to achieve unless there are advance medical technology and higher living standard.', 'With illnesses surfacing and the increase in ageing population, increasing amount of nurses and doctors will have to be present.', 'Back to the ancient days, when human beings firstly appeared on the earth, the average life expectancy is only less than 20.', 'In most countries healthcare are provided freely from government.', 'As with the world is becoming more and more advanced, people are leading a more and more comfortable life.', 'This seems to be a gratifying progress at the first sight.', 'If some bad people want to track someone for their personal purposes, by hacker technology, they can use government tracking system to do their own business.', 'Their lives are becoming meaningless and a lot of them had chosen to suicide without giving troubles to the others.', 'It gives the police a better control of the criminal.', 'However, since the space and resource on earth is very limited, higher life expectancy means more people will live on the earth at the same time and more fierce competition for food and space is unavoidable.', 'For example, it becomes hard for them to earn their livings; they may feel lonely especially if their spouses died; they may suffer from all kinds of diseases.', 'The increasing in population of a country makes the government taking more difficulties of registers the members of each individual family and hence other factors existed as an obstacle of country development.', 'For example, making ordinary people not allowed to use that and do not let the surveillance device accessible to the ordinary people so that abuse usage of surveillance technology can be avoided, which is also a effective way to protect human right.', 'Take Singapore for example, these are installed from highly secured places such as Government sectors to working places, from condominiums to housing development board houses, and even from school canteens to toilets!', 'It may leads a shorter ways to the decision and provide more sales and revenue for company.', 'For example, the tsunami in Tohoku of Japan in 2011 is \" the toughest and the most difficult crisis for Japan in the 65 years after the end of World War II \" as CNN commented.', 'There is needless to doubt that the medical technology has enhanced day by day.', 'Before people find another planet to live, the earth is the only habitat for us, and hence the limit of its capacity to support livings, it is the limit of the quantity of people that can live.', \"Maybe that's one reason for the reducing of the birth rate.\", 'The challenge will be increase the quality of life while being environmentally sustainable.', 'There is no absolute perfect way, so we have done a good job on the road.', 'Risks can be analyzed if there is a record of what was happened in the past.', 'Furthermore, thanks to the development of technology, that the birth rate is increasing while the death rate is decreasing accelerates population aging and increasing.', \"Thus, when a man with a 'terrorism tag' entering a junction or a plaza full of people police should notice this and observe the man's behavior as well as checking his package to prevent him from explode TNT.\", 'It is a break-through of technology and science, and an outstanding achievement of human wisdom.', 'However, it is considered as an achievement as there is low competency in workforce.', 'However, in some opinions, these auto-tracking services break the rule of privacy.', 'In the transportation, almost all of the people have transport cards for daily transport.', 'The technology is always improving and it never stops, and the lifespan of people are getting longer as well.', 'However, when surveillance technology starts to violet the privacy of people instead of being used in a more benefitial way towards people, it is my opinion, that, such technology should rethink its way of existence.', 'Leasing of private information, even though it only happened one time, but one is too many for an individual.', 'With the development of the science and technology, people nowadays are living under various surveillances, for example, CCTVs can be seen almost everywhere in public area.', 'In the same time, it also frees a great amount of labor.', 'No matter how good and how many security systems are there for us, the hackers are also increasingly improving their skills in terms of hacking and breaking the codes of the security system.', 'Furthermore, to make livings, many senior citizens go back to work field.', \"Prisoners' privacy is endangered due to the RFID.\", 'In the ancient times, the residents may only live for 30 years; but now, the life expectancy can be 80s in many countries.', 'Statistics shows that worldwide, the average life expectancy at birth was 66.57 years for 2009 according to CIA World Factbook 2009.', 'Video surveillance gives people a sense of security should anything happen.', 'A long-lived and healthy individual is sometimes being related to the good standard of living and healthcare services that one received.', 'The ability to track every individual will empower dictators and their secret polices.', \"This survey evidently shows that big achievement has been made in the medical area and people's living standard has been improved.\", 'During the less developed times, due to disasters like droughts ,floods or severe contagious disease like black deaths, people at that time could lose their property and lives easily since they do not have enough power to protect themselves and restore their life in a short time.', 'In history, there were times when the government wants to secure its gorvernance so badly that its police sniffed around people like dogs, such as the Nazi Germany, the Soveit Union.', 'While as it becomes highly developed, it is very scary to realize that this technology actually tells lots of people where did you go and what did you do.', 'Finally, the company tracking system has no meaning at all, therefore tracking system is very terrible measure to control people.', 'There are many factors which will result in the death of people, such as natural disasters, accident, diseases or suicides.', 'Human rights were raised up pretty frequently in the world over the past few years.', \"For the privacy concern, if the technology can be made to adjust to human being's feeling, it will be more welcomed.\", 'This form of tracking were also not harmful to any person where they much of these information were all used for helping a person then disrupt the lives of human race.', 'Apart from diseases themselves, deficiency of medication system coverage and inefficiency during the treatment process can also restrict to make lifespan longer.', 'Moreover, the money spend on telephone call record is $1.8 million per year.', 'An example of making an good informed decision is the story of the planning and constructing of a walking path, where the government has a lack of information and decides that the people needs a proper concrete walking path and builds one at a randomly location.', 'I think that the track can be saved in some place which is not open to public.', 'For example, this can be a very beneficial and useful device for police force to track crime suspects and terrorists for their movements, or contributing to more leads for solving a case.', 'It is more secure for us because in potential sense we think with longer life expectancy it is harder for people to die out.', 'In summary, the rising average life span is both a challenge and an achievement because it means the increase of the load and the advance of society, including at least advaced advanced health care system, reduced hazards from the environment and the ubiquitous good will for senior citizens, at the same time.', \"The surveillance technology deteriorates the problem by stalking on people's privacy openly which may arouse anger and unhappiness among people.\", 'Once people have their own identity confirmed, they can even need not to bring any money along with them.', 'Overall, the benefit of these technologies overweight its problems occurred if people use it wisely.', 'However, video surveillance may be a help to most sectors, it can also be misused by many people.', 'Government should also make a bigger amount of pension expenditure.', 'First, food resource and medication resource are the most important to support the living human beings.', 'His friend is able to upload his location due to this advanced technology.', 'Therefore, this technology carries great risk when we can only see the advantages that has been appeared.', 'Besides, tracking people with potential danger will be helpful for the safety department to predict the harm and better avoid the problem.', 'Ageing population is often viewed negatively by the developed countries where they are economic driven.', 'Personally, I think surveillance technology such as RFID (radio-frequency identification) should not be used to track people, for the benefit it brings to me cannot match the concerns it causes.', \"However, as the technology develops, it increased people's mobility and productivity so as life expectancies.\", 'Ageing results in less manpower and less highly educated people are available in proportion.', 'If pupils feel uncomfortable being watched by parents, citizens definitely are unhappy being watched by the big brother.', 'This can cause more societal issues such as lower satisfaction of working groups towards the government, decreasing birth rates where people could not afford the children expenses of their upbringings and educational fees, that adds on more burdens and worries for the government.', 'Some people think RFID should be banned out of privacy consideration.', 'Rising life expectancy is a challenge in a sense that it is highly relied on development of medication.', 'And all the evidences have been collected by hidden surveillance when he though he was expressing his opinion in the safe house!', 'In history, there were times when the government wants to secure its gorvernance so badly that its police sniffed around people like dogs, such as the Nazi Germany, the Soveit Union.', 'One of the basic rights of human is the right for privacy.', 'Thirdly, it is also a waste of time and money if we use it in our daily life.', 'It is such a challenge that human being cannot avoid and must solve.', 'This is an age which most people is retired and has no sources of incomes.', 'More challenges also include the environment challenges that are seen over the years.', 'In fact, people are getting more exposed in public through the fast development of the virtual world-the internet.', 'With the grand medical skill we are having nowadays, human lived longer and hence, a great increasing in population.', 'Privacy must be respected, and power over other should be controlled.', 'The reason why the life expectancies have aroused is that we are becoming more and more clever due to the evolution, and we are becoming richer and richer due to the knowledge we have learned.', 'With the information about the location of the cargo, it is much easier to prevent unexpected loss and come up with more efficient plans to save the energy and resources of the company.', 'Also tracking people is very dangerous if it has been controlled by bad men in a not good purpose.', 'Contrarily, it can help to supervise the public figures in politics and track the offenders in security.', 'On medicine, people have done a lot of researches on life science.', \"The surveillance technology deteriorates the problem by stalking on people's privacy openly which may arouse anger and unhappiness among people.\", 'Taken together, we should say that the rise of life expectancies is two sided.', 'Statisticians can use these data to build up appropriate models to predict the future needs for each city so that local governments know where and when to build more infrastructures, what kind of infrastructures and what other development should be made.', 'However, this proposal has led to fierce argument in the world over its pros and cons.', 'Compare the technology today and the past, we can see that a lot of deceases are treatable, the number of people that died because of the deceases that is not treatable decreases.', 'The rest of their life has to be relied on their family and the financial support from the others.', 'For this part, not only the privacy problem is concerned, but the human health.', 'The benefits of the surveillance are obvious in the fighting of SARS, and this is a success example of the surveillance.', 'For the whole society, rising life expectancies are a symbol of more advances science and technology especially in the medical field, better social environment and a safer world.', 'Maybe, it is because the modern society is become more and more competitive, the parents are paying much attention and importance to their career.', 'If that technology is abandoned, it may trigger more bad people to commit murder or stole things since it is very difficult for the police to track them and they have a high possibility of not being punished by the law.', 'People may say that surveillance technology will be abused intentionally by authorized people.', 'So more manpower will be employed, which deduces the labour in other area.', 'The advance technology saves lots of lives which should never come to this world or should pass away.', 'The first one is that rising life expectancies can be considered as a challenge.', 'Even though people with cancer, which is still hard to cure, now have more chance to survive and have a longer time to live.', 'For the logistics, if all the products are attached to the tags, it is much easier to count and record all the products.', 'An atmosphere of death covered the whole world.', 'Travelers survive in desert thanks to GPS guide them.', 'An example will be in Korea.', 'It would be great if life expectancies keep rising up day by day, but in reality, it does not seem to be so easy.', 'With the development of society, of the past thousands of years, the technology is progressing and the concern for health is arising, so that higher life expectancies are achieved.', 'With the development of society, of the past thousands of years, the technology is progressing and the concern for health is arising, so that higher life expectancies are achieved.', 'The technology is based on the chip implant or tag.', 'Definitely, there are point of view that agree the technology but also the voices of objection.', 'In addition, tracking people system may be used by bad people in a wrong way.', 'By law, citizens have the rights to keep their privacy unknow to public, whereas the privacy would be exposed if such surveillance technology is applied widely.', 'In my opinion, the increase in population age is more a challenge than an achievement.', 'On the condition that the kindergarten students are very young and they do not have a very sound self-conscious, this system can prevent them from lost.', 'We just take the challenge and enjoy the achievement.', 'Such incident happened in London a few years ago, when the government installed CCTV () on several streets in order to better supervise its people to keep the social order.', 'Recently, a new coming surveillance technology called radio-frequency identification which is RFID for short has caused heated discussions on whether it should be used to track people.', 'The family members must be worrying a lot about the lost elderly, and with the help of police office, maybe they can find the elderly back, but it will take a long time, and a lot of energy to find someone in a country has a population about five million without knowing the exact location of that person.', 'On one hand, if there are less young people and more old people, lacking work force problem will arise.', 'Rising expectancies is also an environmental challenge because a better quality of life requires a lot of energy.', 'So according to the humanism, people should make contribution to rising the humans life, because people should consider the feelings if one day when you are becoming older and older, so respecting life should be considered carefully.', 'As to surveillance technology which is not only inefficient enough in improving our life quality but also violating our right of privacy, I think we should not use it to track people.', 'Only in this way can we get evidence of bad movement to protect others.', 'Besides that, many animals which just be released from the protection of human for a long time are implanted the RFID as well to track their new life to ensure whether they could survive in the wild life.', \"At that time, Singapore government adopted the method to install surveillances in every patient's home to look after their actions.\", 'However, the fact is that such technology will create check points everywhere.', \"In the modern society privacy is a hot topic in peoples' mind.\", 'Rising life expectancies also indicates that standard of living is improved for majority of people.', 'This is because of two reasons, one is the strict law in Singapore, and the other is the dense surveillances everywhere.', 'However, ageing population will also increase many kinds of other expenditure.', 'Actually, this technology is very useful and should be definitely go on be used.', 'More challenges also include the environment challenges that are seen over the years.', 'When people become old, most of them join the weak group of citizens who have to live by receiving care from other people.', 'Population ageing also has brought us a question on whether we should raise life expectancies, it is challenging also can get some achievement.', \"Thus, let's us discuss the pros and cons now to give you a clearer minds of surveillance technology.\", 'Instead, when news of the installment of such device was released on the newspaper, it was heavily cricised by the public.', 'Population ageing is a phenomenon observed exclusively in advanced civilizations.It requires at least three conditions to happen: advanced health care system, reduced hazards from the environment and the ubiquitous good will for senior citizens.', 'In conclusion, the reason why population ageing is increasing majority is due to the great improvement of the global medical science.', 'Firstly, security systems are improved in many areas such as school campus or at the workplace.', 'It is more secure for us because in potential sense we think with longer life expectancy it is harder for people to die out.', 'In front of ATM we need monitor to avoid intentional crime.', 'Secondly, for the older people, more facilities and service for them should be provided.', 'The rising expectancies are considered as a challenge as less workforce is resulted if population ages; high burden for governments to support the sources of living for excessive ageing people.', 'Although rising of life expectancies is an challenge to the entire human nation, the detailed problems each country that will encounter is different.', 'Such environmental hazards come from various aspects.', 'All of these are human achievements in their own rights that have resulted in rising life expectancies, and hence they also illustrates why rising expectancies can be considered an achievement.', 'From one perspective, it shows that the medical technology has improved over the years as people now are able to treat different deceases.', 'Radio-frequency identification is a technology which uses a wireless non-contact system to scan and transfer the data from a tag attached to people or products with radio-frequency electromagnetic field.', 'People needs a safe environment to live in, and also needs a private environment to stay independent.', 'Thanks to the development of technology and society, some deadly diseases in the past are curable now, and people are more aware of how to take care of our body.', 'This already raises up a problem of privacy leakage.', 'This can increase the efficiency of solving the crime and thus decreasing the amount of criminal acts or people.', 'With the ageing population, many countries are facing the same challenge as to build safety houses, facilities to cater to the old aged.', 'Moreover, the increased technologies help people to overcome different natural disasters.', 'With the glory, there comes problems.', 'Now, technology and science develops at an unbelievably fast pace.', 'In my opinion, the challenge interception is to make comparison in the cross direction, which is comparing the current situation with the assumed situation.', 'Although someone would say the information is secured very well and will not be released or misused by any purpose, it is still not appropriate.', 'By RFID, the customer who is potential to buy a very expensive luxury will be less reluctant to consider what if it lost, because the RFID can help them get it back.', 'It is highly plausible that the results for increase are the same as the developed countries.', 'No matter where people go, taking bus or MRT, people are under the CCTVs, it is very important and useful to track and find people.', 'In this, I mean that we can input this device implant into an animal or birds species, for us to track their movements and actions relating to our human research that can bring us to a new regime.', 'Spying and collecting excessive information of individuals is the first step.', 'At the same time, our location should be protected from seen by the strangers.', \"An individual is an unit of the society, every good individual thus is a precious contribution to the society and nation's growth.\", 'When the percentage of old people grows larger in the population, the labor is considered to become less and each labor need to pay more on the welfare of the old people.', 'As with the world is becoming more and more advanced, people are leading a more and more comfortable life.', 'In the social science report last year, this number will further increase to 90 years old in 2080s due to the advance medical technology and better living standard.', 'By RFID, the customer who is potential to buy a very expensive luxury will be less reluctant to consider what if it lost, because the RFID can help them get it back.', \"Surveillance technologies should also not be used to protect people's liberty and freedom of opinion.\", 'People will act as if there is no supervision.', \"As we know that population of human continues in growth year by year, we are using the non-recoverable natural resources in everyday life, for example, the oil, people's life and technology improvement are not able to continue without the usage of oil.\", 'At the same time, our location should be protected from seen by the strangers.', 'In solution, surveillance technology has been used in a much broader area.', 'The increasing longevity is due to fast development of the society so as the living pressure.', 'Nowadays, humans live in a modern society.', 'If the medical cost is covered by the government budget, the deficit will be a heavy burden affecting the normal operation of the government.', 'Although some countries in Africa and Southeast Asia still face a lack of medical insurance, the world in all is getting better in the field.', \"As we know that population of human continues in growth year by year, we are using the non-recoverable natural resources in everyday life, for example, the oil, people's life and technology improvement are not able to continue without the usage of oil.\", 'Still the possible downfall of these surveillance technologies is too present in my paranoid mind and they clearly overweight the benefits, in my opinion.', 'First, food resource and medication resource are the most important to support the living human beings.', 'However, the health level of world population shows an increasing trend due to advancing medical technology and it leads to exponential growth in number of elders worldwide.', 'It gives the police a better control of the criminal.', 'Times change, people change.', 'If our spiritual aspect of civilization cannot match our material aspect, old people will have a tough twilight years.', 'No matter where people go, taking bus or MRT, people are under the CCTVs, it is very important and useful to track and find people.', 'According to news, the police force had mobilized thousand of cops, each of them prepared on duty and patrol in an allocated place all over the country and after few months, none of them was able to find Mat Selamat and rearrested him.', 'By projections of the United Nations, it is shown that population aged more than 60 is increasing at 2% to 3% in the developed and developing countries respectively.', 'For instance, when people getting old, they begin to loss their memory and sometimes they may not remember their way to home or other place.', 'The goal of every species of living things is reproducing to increase the quantity of this species.', 'With the popularization of surveillance technology, a more concise and more complete regulations of using that is highly needed.', 'They will be more vulnerable to be hurt or get some injures.', 'Some years, there is a report on Hong Kong citizens living situation, in a small room there are eight people, they cannot do anything in the room, only can sleep and the air in the room is very bad.', 'In the first place, it must have grasped advanced health care system.', 'It is deniable that population ageing can cause a lot of problems, but in the same time, it is also a symbol of improvement.', 'By taking an example in any country, there are crimes everyday and it is obvious to see that not all the culprits had been arrested and being punished.', 'As the population ageing are growing, as people getting old, they need to be cared by others and are not able to contribute as the same as they were young.', \"In the reality, people are afraid of being tracking everywhere, not because of meaning to crime, but the spirit of freedom and privacy is in everyone's heart.\", 'It is said that kimchi can reduce the chances of having cancer and in addition, the people will have a good skin complexion.', 'So, the mark for how long is the life expectancy is indicating how well people is living.', 'However, among the under-developed countries, developing countries and developed countries, we found that there is longest life span in the developed countries follows by the developing countries and the shortest life span in under-developed countries.', 'Not only the details of location will be provided, but also may lead to find out the root of this kind of children trading agency and it helps to prevent more this kind of tragedy to happen on any family.', 'Nowadays, technology is more advance than the past time.', 'When the technology is not so well developed, it may not be a big problem for leaking limited information.', 'In the novel 1984, written by George Orwell, author imagines a world in which people are being watched by the big brother when they doing everything.', 'It may cost higher social cost burden which further leads to the allocation of funds in government yearly budget.', 'Nevertheless, human still need an improvement.', 'As a result, people have more time to enjoy advantage of modern life.', 'When the elders live longer, the family size actually increases rather than decreases.', 'Travelers survive in desert thanks to GPS guide them.', 'Today, the surveillance technology has become almost manifest to wherever we go.', 'Only police should be allowed to use surveillance technology and such technology can only be used to help tracking the murders or people suspected.', 'In another word, there are more elders who have lower productivity and more medical problems compare to younger people in this world population.', 'Surveillance technology is one of the main concerns of military and national defense sectors.', 'People needs a safe environment to live in, and also needs a private environment to stay independent.', 'Without the agreement, people should not able to use this technology to track others.', 'Still the possible downfall of these surveillance technologies is too present in my paranoid mind and they clearly overweight the benefits, in my opinion.', 'Rising Life Expectancies, Not Only an Achievement, But Also a Challenge', 'It is well-known statistics that, generally, as a country develops the life expectancies increases.', 'Con, on the other hand, in terms of tangible aspect mainly in the economic drive and desire of the nation for the sustainability of their economic position and reputation in the world.', \"It is to prevent from sending them to old folk's house and do not visit them at all.\", 'We cannot deny that Surveillance technology is a great achievement that securing us and protect us from criminal but we also cannot ignore the lease of our privacy and even limit our freedom.', 'In that case, if they get lost or lose contact, they will be considered as the lost and eventually, they will not survive.', 'The rising life expectancies are like a two side sword to the modern world.', 'Examples of how advance health in the city has raised life expectancies are such as antibiotics, the cure of poliomyelitis, and better and cleaner surgical procedures.', 'Moreover, the use of RFID chip in tracking clothes were also very common sight in the service industry for the huge number of clothing to be identified and tracked the location of it at any one point.', 'We are modernized and we have gained improved living standard and medical care.', 'If such thing does happen, then the society would be moving on a dangerous direction without being noticed.', 'The chip identifier technology can be reproduced by anyone.', 'Then if his house got stolen, the perhaps he can use the surveillance to get his money back.', 'Above all, the population aging will be a great challenge for the world for it drags the development of a society.', 'If there had been a monitor in the classroom, maybe parents and headmaster could realize earlier how severe and how bad the truth was and children could get protection earlier.', 'To summary, we respect every life, also help people to live longer.', 'An example of making an good informed decision is the story of the planning and constructing of a walking path, where the government has a lack of information and decides that the people needs a proper concrete walking path and builds one at a randomly location.', 'That is to say, there are more and more doubts raised by the public about the surveillance technology.', 'In China, there is a famous saying that there are things should be celebrated, one is red and one is white.', 'This is the interpretation of challenge for rising life expectancies.', 'Both of the two reasons will decrease the number of died people annually.', 'However, it is fairly fragile which can be counter-used by criminals at current level.', 'The war kills a lot of people, which is not doubtful.', 'I need to dress up neatly in case one day someone checks the CCTV will find a girl in weird clothing.', 'Therefore, the increase of life expectancies is also a great challenge.', 'There are also medical tools that are more of implant into the human body for the basic medical research.', 'For society, when the group of old people becomes larger and less people can work for the society, this society may lack of labours.', 'In other words, government originally hopes to use tracking system to ensure citizens safety, now it has been divulged human information.', 'There is one thing is common in the world described in many fiction - chips are implanted in human and records its location, history and even thoughts at that time.', 'Without advanced health care system, aged people have higher rate of death.', 'Surveillance technology will help to prevent the family to loss their member especially the elderly and the children which need to be pay more attention to.', \"It is to prevent from sending them to old folk's house and do not visit them at all.\", 'As the aging population grows, the young and more energetic people are subject to support more people of old age.', 'By law, citizens have the rights to keep their privacy unknow to public, whereas the privacy would be exposed if such surveillance technology is applied widely.', 'However, such rapid advancement technology though can be extremely useful to our daily life; it can also cause the invisible or massive threats to our peaceful livings that can be out of our imaginations and estimations.', 'This technology can also be a helpful tool to assist the law enforcers such as the police to collect evidences of crime after it occurred.', 'Ageing population is a consequence of increasing health level of population.', 'It also indicates that the foods the people eat are nourishing and can decrease the amount of illness that can cause death, thus living longer.', 'Nowadays, with the rapid development of science and technology, the emerging technologies always contribute to human beings better living conditions.', 'This is not imaginable during less developed times.', 'This is an age which most people is retired and has no sources of incomes.', 'Thanks to the development of technology and society, some deadly diseases in the past are curable now, and people are more aware of how to take care of our body.', 'Such situation is a major progress from the ancient time and also a big achievement by all human beings.', 'Many of this surveillance are being implemented in the government sectors, military areas to enhance their security.', 'Much media has reported the effective measures of installing the surveillances in Singapore.', 'The past 30-year rapid development of China is connected with the large population, but due to the \" only child \" policy, we have no benefits from large population in the future.', 'Every moves of us are easily tracked.', 'The rising of life expectancy globally can be challenging and yet an achievement when the problems of human could be medically disturbing.', 'Before robots can fully replace labor, the decreasing of generating power indicate less creativity and less goods available for us to use.', 'The technology is necessary because it can provide evidence in crime investigation and social issues and decrease the illegal actions effectively.', 'When a husband is talking a sweet sentence to his wife, none of the couple want it to be heard by the people behind the monitors.', \"There is a Chinese saying that there is nothing more valuable than to save a man's life.\", 'Once it is very severe, the records will be pop out for official use.', 'If we cannot choose the proper way to use it, we taste the bad consequences of it.', 'Although we are not implanted chips we are exposed under CCTV.', 'Therefore I agree that the use of the RFID technology in tracking any person or product that would help the human race which also been mention above.', 'By law, citizens have the rights to keep their privacy unknow to public, whereas the privacy would be exposed if such surveillance technology is applied widely.', 'Rising life expectancies can bring us more skilled work force because we can delay the retirement time to extend working time for each person.', 'People are happy to see that they can finally live a long life without sacrificing their blood in battles and with more and more perfect medical insurance.', 'On the other hand, if there are enough young people, then young people with rising life expectancies will cause larger population.', 'To pay this extra money, government will exert higher taxed on the other people.', 'Not only the details of location will be provided, but also may lead to find out the root of this kind of children trading agency and it helps to prevent more this kind of tragedy to happen on any family.', 'This would result in decrease in birth rate of a country which is a very serious problem,especially in more developed countries as the population has already reached a minimum.', 'Without all this technology we may need to live in the same condition like centuries ago, with a higher death rate when diseases spread around the world and the human nations have no solution.', 'This technology leads to a problem which is same with the prisoner issue that is the human privacy.', 'And at the same time, these old people take up a larger portion of resource and budges of this society.', \"However, this shall not be entangled with the idea that high life expectancy equates of a nation's provision of quality healthcare benefits and livings for the senior citizens.\", 'By using this technology reasonably, it will assist people to walk faster and further in the long and rough civilization developing path.', 'Moreover, as showed in many Hollywood movies, Google mail is also accessible for FBI.', 'And also the over crowded modern cities also raise problem of public transportations, unevenly distributed wealth and education resources shortage also are the problems that some countries that may face to.', 'This is not imaginable during less developed times.', 'Population ageing is not all about the good side of the society though.', \"Thus, the rising expectancies actually reflect the increasing stability and comfort of people's life and indirectly reflecting the ability of government to provide people of their current comforts, economical statues, convenience and others.\", \"Some good examples such as the Internet, computers and satellites are now quite common for humans' normal life; however, some problems also emerge, with a concern of the loss of the privacy of civilians.\", 'This important information may be needed to save the person life where their medical history was all recorded in the chip.', 'These few problems were taking a toll in human lives over the years when they were over 60 years of age.', 'Nowadays, technology is more advance than the past time.', 'Radio-frequency identification is a technology which uses a wireless non-contact system to scan and transfer the data from a tag attached to people or products with radio-frequency electromagnetic field.', 'Healthcare is better than in the past.', 'The expression of desperation can be seen everywhere.', 'Cars and trucks diminish the redundancy of long time shipment.', 'Under the products tags, children are given a significant free space as compared to the congested control by human implant.', 'Their safety may face huge challenge.', 'However, it is an achievement as it is an indication that our society is progressed well and people are living with better conditions.', 'If everyone is being watched unknowingly, it seems that our freedom of doing things is being invaded.', 'Rising life expectancies also indicates that standard of living is improved for majority of people.', 'They are not contradicting with each other.', 'The rising expectancies are considered as a challenge as less workforce is resulted if population ages; high burden for governments to support the sources of living for excessive ageing people.', 'Surveillance technology will help to prevent the family to loss their member especially the elderly and the children which need to be pay more attention to.', 'So more manpower will be employed, which deduces the labour in other area.', 'One of the basic rights of human is the right for privacy.', 'Two of the most important causes of ageing problem is the increasing longevity and declining fertility.', 'On the other hand, if there are enough young people, then young people with rising life expectancies will cause larger population.', 'In order to cope with the ageing population that pulls down or hinders the economic development, more physically capable and young workforces are required in the society.', 'For example, it becomes hard for them to earn their livings; they may feel lonely especially if their spouses died; they may suffer from all kinds of diseases.', 'However, once the government gathers too much power, the democracy may be turned into totalitarianism, and such surveillance technology provides the measures.', 'Thirdly, compared to the young people, the security of the elderly is more notable.', 'All the achievements human make influence the lifespan of people.', 'However, there are both sides of stories.', 'Therefore, surveillance technology makes our society more ordered.', 'The tags can be used on those who need to be took care or the beloved ones, such as a child whose parents are always concerning about his whereabouts when parents are not together with him, or maybe a lovely dog whose owner fears to lost her.', 'Rising life expectancies result in fewer workforces available.', 'However, this rising life expectancies have become a challenge and also and an achievement in the population ageing.', 'Therefore I agree that the use of the RFID technology in tracking any person or product that would help the human race which also been mention above.', 'This can protect the students from being in a dangerous situation in particularly for the small children who are studying in nursery.', 'It gives you the feeling that all people are watching a movie, and you are the hero whose every movement including using the toilet is under others observation, just like what was showed in the movie The Truman Show which chronicles the life of a man who is initially unaware that he is living in a constructed world, broadcast to billions of people.', 'However, it is not a reasonable idea to use RFID to track people by human implants or RFID tags on daily products like watch or clothes, it did provide convenience in a certain situation.', 'In conclusion, there are challenges as well as achievement in the rising life expectancies which we cannot exclude.', 'However, during the process of making development to our life, we decide to reduce the rapid growth of population by adopting the measure of controlling birth so that the shortage of source allocation can also be slowed down.', 'Actually, living a longer life needs a lot of conditions to realize.', 'With this advantage, it will be easier for people to locate his friend or his family when they lost contact or in an urgent and also for police to investigate crimes.', 'Beside, if RFID is supposed to be use by the public, everyone will be able to locate their friends and also their dearest family.', 'Rising life expectancies is an achievement because it is an evidence of progress of modern medical technology and meanwhile it is a challenge because it can incur the problem of lacking work force or too large population.', 'Back to the surveillance technology, people may say it leaks their privacy or personal life.', 'As for the future, who knows?', 'Therefore, the increase of life expectancies is also a great challenge.', \"On the other hand, there are not sufficient materials or ways to improve people's daily life.\", 'As a result, people have more time to enjoy advantage of modern life.', 'Rising life expectancies is also an achievement to governments.', 'Another rising life expectancy is a bigger house with a lower price which is raised up by younger generation.', 'Although the surveillance technology is an issue in invading the human privacy, it has also brought us lots of benefits and security.', \"It represents a query: is not everyone can view each other's information such as name and age?\", 'More variation of medical needs was required to help increase the life expectancy of any human.', 'Example of this technology is RFID (radio-frequency identification) which has been proposed to track people through various means such as human implants or RFID tags on people.', 'On one hand, if there are less young people and more old people, lacking work force problem will arise.', 'Population ageing is a phenomenon observed exclusively in advanced civilizations.It requires at least three conditions to happen: advanced health care system, reduced hazards from the environment and the ubiquitous good will for senior citizens.', 'They are expecting better medication, healthier food, and cleaner environment and so on and so forth.', 'To our disappointment, now the technology is not so advanced that it can generate all human beings by using limited resources.', 'In conclusion, we could see that on order to solve the challenges such as the amount of illness that could be growing over the year, the damage to our living environment and stresses that are always building in the city life.', 'Since this is happen more often in the country which is much larger than Singapore, it is even harder or maybe it is impossible for the parents to find the child back without knowing where the child has been brought to.', 'When the authority treats liberty as a crime, the society becomes terrible.', 'During the less developed times, due to disasters like droughts ,floods or severe contagious disease like black deaths, people at that time could lose their property and lives easily since they do not have enough power to protect themselves and restore their life in a short time.', 'More food, clean water, better sanitation, and healthcare consume large quantities of energy.', 'Reality kills people in mind.', 'Pressure can really cause sickness just like virus and germs and it is more like a chronic disease.', 'Nowadays, people use the all-purpose smart phone for communicating.', 'Our life is not only exposed to big brother.', 'Nowadays, population aging is becoming a problem especially in the developed countries.', 'Obviously, rising life expectancies should also be considered as a serious challenge.', 'An improvement in engineering and medical science had been valued since humanism arises.', 'But before the application, governments need to secure safety of RFID after implantation and make sure there will not be any ID theft.', \"At that time, even if there is no surveillance above people's heads, there are surveillances in everyone's heart and criminals are more difficult to hide.\", 'Rising life expectancies could be seen as a good or a bad trend to others.', 'Once people have their own identity confirmed, they can even need not to bring any money along with them.', 'There is always a way out where the achievements were done by the humans who used their time to help most people improve our basic needs and life for the living and extension of our life expectancy.', 'People are able to predicate some disasters like the earth quake and do the prevention beforehand.', 'Therefore, we must agree with the statement before the technology is able to track us.', 'Everyone knows the internet and data transmission are very common and accessible at any time and point such as Facebook.', 'As the society develops, people gradually find that population ageing brings us many problems.', 'Without the using of the surveillance, the epidemic situation could not be controlled strictly, and the loss caused by SARS might be many times than that in 2003 in Singapore.', 'The idea of democracy and power of the people will be at risk if people are tracked.', 'As the amount of stress, the types of food mixed with chemicals and the quality of living in terms of environment were getting worst.', 'Before robots can fully replace labor, the decreasing of generating power indicate less creativity and less goods available for us to use.', 'Therefore, the surveillance technology cannot be casually used.', 'The clothes were all implanted with an RFID tracking chip for easy identification and recording of the whereabouts the clothes is at.', 'We cannot deny that Surveillance technology is a great achievement that securing us and protect us from criminal but we also cannot ignore the lease of our privacy and even limit our freedom.', 'It can help regulate behaviors, prevent crime and set up demographic data base for various uses.', 'We revealed our locations, for our friends to catch up with us, however we can never know who is watching us out there secretly.', 'What should be concerned is how it can be applied in the right area in a right way.', 'Privacy must be respected, and power over other should be controlled.', 'However, the growing life expectancies also mean an achievement to the human society.', 'Contrarily, it can help to supervise the public figures in politics and track the offenders in security.', \"It represents a query: is not everyone can view each other's information such as name and age?\", 'So rising life expectancies will make the world population larger, more people shall the limited resources.', 'Nowadays, the pressure from the head of a company towards those employee caused that people has to be fully concentrate in their jobs and because of that, people starts to ignore their health condition and relies on treatment and supplement.', 'One family at least should take care of four old people.', 'On the other hand, the aging of Population can also be a challenge to the society.', 'Subsequently, a lot of problems regarding to it are arising.', 'Their opinions are founded on the basic human rights.', 'So, in the following, I will clarify these two different views for rising life expectancies.', 'Trends of the highly emotionally and easily manipulated humans can be tracked, analysis, archived and chronicled.', 'Also, the growing percentage of older people will cause the maintenance of many traditional thoughts and mindsets which may become a resistance of the positive social change.', 'As the population ageing are growing, as people getting old, they need to be cared by others and are not able to contribute as the same as they were young.', 'Nonetheless, the issues it brings out are more worthy to be considered.', 'However, disadvantages have also been gradually disappeared as with the fruits people are enjoying.', 'While it is applaudable that people achieved great success in prolonging their lives, there are social challenges posted by the rising life expectancies.', 'On the other hand, the birth rate in many countries keeps decreasing, whose figure is the lowest record comparing to previous figure.', 'Also, not only the kidnappers and the victim need to be tracked down, but also jailbreakers.', \"In the first case, RFID can be used to help parents to surveillance their children so that they can make sure if they are at school or playing around at his friends' home, and this may help parents regulate their children's behavior.\", 'However, when we look at the brighter side of the reality, the rise in life expectancy proves great improvements in various realms and solved many problems we had in the past, there is hope that the aging population may transform into helpful force to a country in the future with the help of better technology and medication.', 'On the other hand, I will also discuss the RFID shall be utilized for good purposes.', 'The more people using it over us, the more power they will have on us.', 'In conclusion, the advanced technology gives people convenience to find their items and their safety.', 'This tracking will help scientists to better get their result and clear exploration route information will also be useful for post-research when scientists come back.', \"For instance, face book as the well known social media platform has the ability of tracking someone's location.\", \"For example, thieves can easily find out the best time to visit our houses and kidnappers can take away our kids every time if they are informed of everyone's location.\", 'In this mean time, surveillance technology is founded which mean that we are able to track people at every time in everywhere.', 'For example, people go somewhere, no matter taking bus, MRT or driving, they are under the CCTVs.', 'This form of tracking is not harmful and disturbing to the society as it could be used to fight crimes to maintain law and order.', 'Furthermore, by telling the geographical position of the people, RFID can accelerate the rescue process and will improve the survival rate of the victims.', 'Rising life expectancies could be seen as a good or a bad trend to others.', \"In some very small and developed regions and countries like Singapore and Hong Kong, if people still increase the humans' life, but for these small developed regions, the resources are very limited especially land.\", 'For an example, one would like to have I-Phone 5 in the past but he or she will expect it to have more functions or operate in faster speed after using it a while.', \"This fact becomes very controversial among people and the possibility of personal information releasing without knowing also brings the public's concern.\", 'Actually, tracking system has provided people safety indemnification.', 'This phenomenon is accepted by the public even by those who do not own a pet.', 'Because the life and health are most significant, people have their own reasons to hope living longer.', 'The increasing in population of a country makes the government taking more difficulties of registers the members of each individual family and hence other factors existed as an obstacle of country development.', 'Ageing population requires more medical sources since elders needs more medical attention.', 'There exist various advantages of using the surveillance technology.', 'There was a saying which says that hunger can bring people back to animals.', 'However, among the under-developed countries, developing countries and developed countries, we found that there is longest life span in the developed countries follows by the developing countries and the shortest life span in under-developed countries.', 'However, among the under-developed countries, developing countries and developed countries, we found that there is longest life span in the developed countries follows by the developing countries and the shortest life span in under-developed countries.', 'Additionally, the service industry were also using it to track its clothes that were been used by their employees.', 'After going through the WW1 and WW2, the population on the earth got much fewer.', 'Actually, this technology is very useful and should be definitely go on be used.', 'We cannot give up what we achieved in the past and follow the natural way die and reborn.', 'RFID can be one of the trivial ways to help dispel criminal or terroristic thoughts.', 'When people start to age, many diseases will surface up un-noticing.', 'In another words, it indicates that the national healthcare system is effective, well-managed by the Government.', 'So, the mark for how long is the life expectancy is indicating how well people is living.', \"Thus, let's us discuss the pros and cons now to give you a clearer minds of surveillance technology.\", 'On the other hand, the achievement perceiving is to make comparison in the wire direction, which is comparing the current situation with the historical situation in the past.', 'To summary, we respect every life, also help people to live longer.', 'We are no longer bothered by starving and common illness.', 'People are happy to see that they can finally live a long life without sacrificing their blood in battles and with more and more perfect medical insurance.', 'A major source of the hazards is the pollution.', 'In addition, people who research in biodiversity will also need to be tracked.', 'However, based on the humanism, humans are different from the animals, people should respect every life.', 'Economics can take advantage of these figures to predict the economic trend of local as well as the whole country.', 'We cannot give up what we achieved in the past and follow the natural way die and reborn.', 'Studies have shown that the life span is getting longer which reflects the rising of life expectancies.', 'It can benefit our mankind if appropriately used.', 'Thus, we should not compare now with the past but we need to worried about the future problems that caused by this situation.', 'Since RFID tags attached to the product can remain functional for a long period of time, it could be misused for surveillance purposed which are not related to the industries production or supply activities.', 'So more manpower will be employed, which deduces the labour in other area.', 'To make him or her more competitive so that not be beat by the younger, old people usually accept lower compensation or bonus.', 'In this essay, I will discuss that if surveillance technology such as RFID (radio-frequency identification) should be used or not to track people.', 'Their lives are becoming meaningless and a lot of them had chosen to suicide without giving troubles to the others.', 'Surveillance technology

brings problems such as increased expenses and reduced labors to the society.', 'Therefore, the patient will have a bigger chance to be cured and survive.', 'What should be concerned is how it can be applied in the right area in a right way.', 'In economic, we can use GDP to explain the challenge, if GDP is low, it shows that most of people are living in a hard life, life quality is bad, then it will cause the terrible society problem, at last, it will happen the society disturbance.', 'These two words can be seen from various media and assessments of this social trend are of great number.', 'Such incident happened in London a few years ago, when the government installed CCTV () on several streets in order to better supervise its people to keep the social order.', 'This is just like there is an invisible stalker behind you.', 'The more old people the country has, the more experience they will be as most elderly people can share their old experiences with the younger generation and

comfort of people's life and indirectly reflecting the ability of government to provide people of their current comforts, economical statues, convenience and others.\", 'Moreover, the use of RFID chip in tracking clothes were also very common sight in the service industry for the huge number of clothing to be identified and tracked the location of it at any one point.', 'It is a big challenge to

they doing everything.', 'Thus, food can play an important role to the population.', 'Less money will be left to develop the country and explore into new areas of business.', 'The rising average life expectancies can surely cause some problems.', 'There are a series of problems that hinders longevity such as current medication.', 'As technology becomes more advanced nowadays, people are very exposed to the various types of technology in their daily lives.', 'Therefore, we need to continue on our striving as try our best to reduce the adverse impact that is carried.', 'For example, it becomes hard for them to earn their livings; they may feel lonely especially if their spouses died; they may suffer from all kinds of diseases.', 'Although we have to admit some bad effect which is brought up by the new technology, still the advantages of the new technologies cannot be simply discarded.', 'To make him or her more competitive so that not be beat by the younger, old people usually accept lower compensation or bonus.', 'Ageing population is a prolonged and persistent societal problem that is being frowned upon in most of the developed countries.', 'On the other side, we have to say that obvious problems that we are facing are also caused by the rise of life expectancy.', 'In conclusion, the reason why population ageing is increasing majority is due to the great improvement of the global medical science.', \"People's lives become from increasingly convenient to almost luxury, thanks to the implementation of increasingly technology available for the Man's life.\", 'Besides, the elderly with less salary also have to lower their living standard; both the consequences can cause a decrease in social happiness level and drive the whole society in to a less stable situation.', 'In the first place, rising life expectancies could cause resources challenge.', 'Other than that, safety issue can be extended to personal safety.', 'Maybe, it is because the modern society is become more and more competitive, the parents are paying much attention and importance to their career.', 'We have to admit that how to prevent the abuse and how to use it reasonably depend on a sound legal system, and it means surveillance has its own restriction.', \"The improvement in technology also eases people's lives by replacing all the manual labourous works with easy and simple

lost of privacy.', 'I would stand against the idea of tracking individuals given its vulnerabilities of technology at present.', 'Ageing results in less manpower and less highly educated people are available in proportion.', 'Moreover, the life expectancies have also been raised due to the developing of the economy.', 'In order to cope with the ageing population that pulls down or hinders the economic development, more physically capable and young workforces are required in the society.', 'The increasing longevity is due to fast development of the society so as the living pressure.', 'It is well-known statistics that, generally, as a country develops the life expectancies increases.', 'As previously mentioned there are benefits to this surveillance and tracking technologies.', 'Population ageing also has brought us a question on whether we should raise life expectancies, it is challenging also can get some achievement.', 'Here, red thing means marriage and white means someone passing away.', 'If RFID is used on everyone and running for years, surveillance centre will have a complete set of statistic data showing the movement of people from city to city, from town

will have to be present.', 'This is an age which most people is retired and has no sources of incomes.', 'No matter which reason stated above exactly dominant to the rising of life expectancies it is one of the evidence of the achievement of human nation.', 'It is very dangerous for society, because people do not know who are tracking them, it must bring citizens trepidation.', 'The radio-frequency device can be used on old people whose memory is not as good as young people as well.', \"Obviously, rising of life expectancies is a mark of our achievements in terms of hospitalizing

the advantages that has been appeared.', 'In addition, the younger generation eager to start their own family at another place rather than staying together with family.', 'In the developed countries like Japan and Switzerland, the life expectancy can be as high as more than 80.', 'As previously mentioned there are benefits to this surveillance and tracking technologies.', 'For the old people, if they are alone at home, one day, they want to go out for a walk.', 'As the RFID is embedded within the product, people who have the access to the information definitely can track him.', 'Moreover, the use of the RFID for medical research is also been widely used in many countries.', 'All passengers and pilots were died.', 'With the development of the science and technology, people nowadays are

makes the quality of people's life less enjoyable than today.\", 'If there are more young people, then there will be even more elderly with rising life expectancies in the future definitely.', 'We are no longer bothered by starving and common illness.', 'The issue facing us is more challenging and tricky.', 'For example, making ordinary people not allowed to use that and do not let the surveillance device accessible to the ordinary people so that abuse usage of surveillance technology can be avoided, which is also a effective way to protect human right.', 'In short, it can provide a safe, convenient, identifiable environment for human beings.', 'A major source of the hazards is the pollution.', 'Ageing population is a prolonged and persistent societal problem that is being frowned upon in most of the developed countries.', 'All these technology advancement also helps to improve the lives of human race in terms of improving the lifestyle, environment and medical ability.', 'This is the interpretation of challenge for rising life expectancies.', 'Nowadays, population aging is becoming a problem especially in the developed countries.', 'It is unacceptable for some people in the society, however, I think this application is necessary and provides the society a lot of benefit.', 'With increasing age, people become more prone to disease and injury, and more difficult to recover.', 'By investigating the track by the surveillance technology, they can easily figure out where are their kids now and know roughly what they are doing.', 'However, as there are only limited space and resource on earth, rising life expectancy is also a challenge for all the people worldwide.', 'In all, RFID should be applied to facilitate governors to better manage the world that we are

agree to implant the RFID into their children's body.\", 'Nowadays, people use the all-purpose smart phone for communicating.', 'Rising life expectancies is also an achievement to governments.', \"If we have these technologies, it will automatically confirm people's indemnification and save the effort to carry a lot of cards.\", 'One of the examples is the storage of bank account number in the tracking chip.', 'I do not agree this kind of behavior, because humans are different from goods, cannot treat humans as goods.', 'While as it becomes highly developed, it is very scary to realize that this technology actually tells lots of people where did you go and what did you do.', 'The second one is that rising life expectancies can also be considered an achievement.', 'However, this will raise a privacy protection issue.', 'The achievement is some kind of a comparison with the history in the past.', \"The fast development of medicine and technological product makes people's life much healthier compare to the past.\", 'We cannot deny that Surveillance technology is a great achievement that securing us and protect us from criminal but we also cannot ignore the lease of our privacy

modern medical technology.', 'With the population ageing and the increasing portion of the old people, we are facing lots of problems now.', 'Actually, tracking system has provided people safety indemnification.', 'Already without these technologies, the secret police agencies are able to track their prey and unsuspecting rebels.', 'They may die for hunger, die from illness or just went to bed as usual but never waked again.', 'Actually, tracking system has provided people safety indemnification.', 'For the logistics, if all the products are attached to the tags, it is much easier to count and record all the products.', 'For this kind of situation, RFID will help a lot.', 'It can cause many problems but it also means a lot for the human beings.', 'In conclusion, the increase in population age shows both the human technology achievement and the new challenges like lack of young generation.', 'Without all this technology we may need to live in the same condition like centuries ago, with a higher death rate when diseases spread around the world and the human nations have no solution.', \"Every day when I opened my door and go to lady's through the corridor, I was recorded by 3 CCTV.\", 'Some supporters may argue that it will more convenient to use RFID for identification in place like airport and check point.', \"Above all, I think we cannot ban the use of RFID completely, since it will be of great help for human's benefit during scientific exploration, rescue and police events.\", 'Once cancers are too late to discovered, one is deemed to death at a later

age has weaken the labor force and so on.', 'There are also some older people live a rich life with their deposits and retirement compensation.', 'Where every home houses an elderly, the future generations can learn and carry on their traditional and morale values.', 'Although we all understand the installing of CCTV is used for protect us from criminal, nowadays, it seems to be abused too much.', 'It may be a challenge but also golden opportunity to educate their children properly to prevent the undesired outcomes.', 'Also, the population ageing calls for a higher standard of medical treatment and technology, higher level of civilization of our life.', 'In the old times, people could easily lose their life due to hunger, disease, government, war or something else.', 'This will inversely improve the sale of the shop.', 'The rising of life expectancies shows the human nation has overcome some of the challenges of the natural environment around us during the existence of so

groups.', 'In most countries healthcare are provided freely from government.', 'In addition, corrupted officials may sell this tracking information to the mafia.', 'Economics can take advantage of these figures to predict the economic trend of local as well as the whole country.', 'Government should also make a bigger amount of pension expenditure.', 'In other words, government originally hopes to use tracking system to ensure citizens safety, now it has been divulged human information.', 'Besides, we can try to reduce the bad effect cause by the new technology.', 'It can provide a safe, convenient, identifiable environment.', 'For example, if the one who carry the identifiable sensor does not want any other to know his or her location, he or she can disable the track.', 'Beside, if RFID is supposed to be use by the public, everyone will be able to locate their friends and also their dearest family.', 'Secondly, the tracking proposal will raise a safety issue.', 'The expression of desperation can be seen everywhere.', 'Secondly, surveillance technology can decrease the illegal actions effectively.', 'With the glory, there comes problems.', 'There is lots of illness that is thought incurable in the past vanished in the world.', 'This is not imaginable during less developed times.', 'This action could actually generate aggressive feeling from others and violent movement could be launched onto the one with the aid of tracking tag or implant.', 'Already without these technologies, the secret police agencies are able to track their prey and unsuspecting rebels.', 'By RFID, the customer who is potential to buy a very expensive luxury will be less reluctant to consider what if it lost, because the RFID can help them get it back.', 'First, I will discuss on the challenge of having an ageing population such as building more facilities and hospitals that will be needed when the population starts to age and jobs which have no young people taking over which can lead to economic downfall.', 'As the fast growing of electrical technology, people have been trying to adopt more and more advanced technology into our life to make full use of it.', 'That will also cause more social concerns.', 'And after all this scientific research result is applied to daily life, products such as RFID tracking system have become real.', 'As our society develops, the people have a much higher living standard, which will reduce the chance of getting disease.', 'When I have such feelings, I will feel that I am not belongs to human beings as everyone else any longer, instead, I am like a pet or a tool to be made fun of by others.', 'The first time when I read this saying I am confused why someone passing away is a good thing that people should celebrate and later I was told that in past, it is hard to live longer than 60 years old and even though you are very lucky to live longer than 60 years old, you will suffer a lot from illness or the sadness for your young relatives passing away, so people think it is worth celebrating since they will not suffer any longer.', 'If the surveillance technology is abandoned, it makes the police very difficult to track the suspicious people and can have little control of those people who are dangerous to the society.', 'It will also induce many problems.', 'The significance of our existence is to leading a meaningful life and combat for the development of our world.', 'Due the rise of the life span and the shrink of the birth rate, the portion of the elderly portion is larger and larger.', 'As the technology develops faster and faster during 301 years, people not only enjoy more and more materials but also more and more health care which provides convenience in our daily life.', 'Tracking people is one way of abuse technology and in fact, it happened every day.', 'So the rising life expectancies can be regarded as a proof of what we have made to combat for ourselves.', 'No matter how

every second is valuable!', 'People expect more on the ground of their current economy, life stability and desire.', 'Taken together, we should say that the rise of life expectancies is two sided.', 'In addition, elderly people are using same or even more amount of social resource, as they need more medical support and human help caused by their weaker physical status.', 'If the individual or family is to pay the bill, they can be bankrupted because of illness.', 'Therefore, human need to appreciate the longer life span and consider it as an achievement.', 'This results in an unbalanced ratio between young people and older people.', 'However, the consumer may not be aware of the function of the tag, so this action could reveal the sensitive information of the consumers like home address, working address to someone who is not authorized to get the information.', 'More elderly people are a burden to the society as more funds are required by the governments to support their standard of living.', 'In the long history of the evolution, we are always struggling for life against staving and illness.', 'In the first place, rising life expectancies could cause resources challenge.', 'Con, on the other hand, in terms of tangible aspect mainly in the economic drive and desire of the nation for the sustainability of their economic position and reputation in the world.',

use of it.', 'In conclutin, the rising life expectancies can be considered both challenge and achievement.', 'Statistics shows that worldwide, the average life expectancy at birth was 66.57 years for 2009 according to CIA World Factbook 2009.', \"Furthermore, some of parents hold the positive views to surveillance technology and agree to implant the RFID into their children's body.\", 'However, ageing population will also increase many kinds of other expenditure.', 'For the whole society, rising life expectancies are a symbol of more advances science and technology especially in the medical field, better social environment and a safer world.', 'Although in many respects, this technology can be used in positive and evidently beneficial ways, in some area it is so controversial.', 'They will end up putting a burden on the society that they have been contributing their whole working career.', 'It is thus a big challenge to the country as there is no one boosting their economy.', \"There is a Chinese saying that there is nothing more valuable than to save a man's life.\", 'This is because of two reasons, one is the strict law in Singapore, and the other is the dense

the Internet, computers and satellites are now quite common for humans' normal life; however, some problems also emerge, with a concern of the loss of the privacy of civilians.\", 'Some people started to think if electronic products can be further operated to more advanced utilization and replace human beings for better performances.', 'If a country can bear a ageing population, it is a thing that the country can be proud of.', 'Moreover, the life expectancies have also been raised due to the developing of the economy.', 'What we can do now is to try hard to solve the problems and in the same time appreciate its great meanings.', 'When a husband is talking a sweet sentence to his wife, none of the couple want it to be heard by the people behind the monitors.', 'There is a truth that we cannot deny which is that surveillance technology can provide a sense of safety because sometimes machine is more honest than people.', 'There is lots of illness that is thought incurable in the past vanished in the world.', 'In another word, there are more elders who have lower productivity and more medical problems compare to younger people in this world population.', 'Medical expenses, EPF and accommodation are the costs which directly involved to the old people.', 'Patients in many developing and less developed countries, especially African countries, are suffering from simple and easy-to-heal diseases such as cold and flu and probably at the end of the day it becomes the end of their life, albeit they could have been treated well if they were in a country where medication system has been completed and doctors and nurses are standing by to cure these people.', 'By investigating the track by the surveillance technology, they can easily figure out where are their kids now and know roughly what they are doing.', 'Does the implanting chip definitely safe and feasible?', \"Without sending back any images or sound record, RFID is more user-friendly and helps prevent user's privacy at the best it can.\", 'The rising life expectancies best prove these improvements and have definitely written a new chapter on the history human civilisation.', 'To purchase goods, they just need to deduce money from their identity and make a transition of money to the one who is selling the goods.', 'Examples of how advance health in the city has raised life expectancies are such as antibiotics, the cure of poliomyelitis, and better and cleaner surgical procedures.', 'Some people started to think if electronic products can be further operated to more advanced utilization and replace human beings for better performances.', 'Rising life expectancies is an achievement because it clearly demonstrates that overall quality of life is increasing in both developed and developing countries.', \"At that time, even if there is no surveillance above people's heads, there are surveillances in everyone's heart and criminals are more difficult to hide.\", 'To raise life expectancy, one of the questions is how to upgrade the current medication system.', 'The first time when I read this saying I am confused why someone passing away is a good thing that people should celebrate and later I was told that in past, it is hard to live longer than 60 years old and even though you are very lucky to live longer than 60 years old, you will suffer a lot from illness or the sadness for your young relatives passing away, so people think it is worth celebrating since they will not suffer any longer.', 'As the rise of life expectancies can be interpreted as a measure standard of the pace of technology development, it can be seen an achievement of human being.', 'In last two centuries, we human have made the greatest achievement in developing our society.', \"We do not want to be sued infringing other's privacy, therefore, before implanting any RFID, we should ask for other's consent.\", 'Therefore, the increase of life expectancies is also a great challenge.', 'Population ageing also has brought us a question on whether we should raise life expectancies, it is challenging also can get some achievement.', \"It monitors anybody's movement or activity, and enables us to identify suspects involved in any misdoing which violates the law, etc.\", 'However, along with the increase of life expectancies, ageing problems becomes more and more severe.', 'Then try to invent new energy and legitimately control population birth rate, then developing the medical treatment and paying enough attention, we have reasons to trust, population aging will not be problem at all.', 'Therefore, some measurement and education about this should be taken by the government and the surrounding people to ensure the security of the old people.', 'In conclusion, what I have mentioned above, although global aging issue has become more serious on humans development, if we can balance and understand why we live.', 'In spite of that, smart phone is still a device that need to be recharged its battery or else it will be just like a rigid object.', 'So, in the following, I will clarify these two different views for rising life expectancies.', 'RFID can be one of the trivial ways to help dispel criminal or terroristic thoughts.', 'Two of the most important causes of ageing problem is the increasing longevity and declining fertility.', 'Better sanitations will result in fewer deaths by infection and significantly reduce the spread of diseases and viruses.', 'There was everywhere wandering people trying to find food.', 'This would result in economic retardation and stagnation of a country.', 'However, they could have built the walking path on a dirt path that has been walked out by the people themselves.', 'One can easily travel to the other half of the globe to see beautiful scenery that one dreams for his lifetime.', 'The rising life expectancy is a big achievement of human beings.', 'Would not it similar to criminals in prison but in a bigger confined space?', 'Examples of how advance health in the city has raised life expectancies are such as antibiotics, the cure of poliomyelitis, and better and cleaner surgical procedures.', 'Surveillance technology such as RFID (radio-frequency identification) has been made possible to track people by implanting certain markers on people or products.', 'Rising life expectancies result in fewer workforces available.', 'The challenge of many ageing countries will rise when no new generation could take over their place in that particular trade.', 'Actually, tracking system has provided people safety indemnification.', \"This may lead to the younger's lower employment rate and opportunities and thus they have to live with huge pressure and lower living standard to reduce the daily cost.\", 'We are on the right track.', \"This can help to regulate people's behavior, control crime and prevent terrorism, and set up demographic data.\", \"With modern machine and growing method, human don't need to worry about the amount of food anymore.\", \"Hence, as technology especially in the medical field continues to get developed and updated, people don't risk their lives anymore.\", 'Will it affect the normal functionality of the other organs?', 'Studies have shown that the average life span or human being rising gradually over years, in the sense that the improvement of global technology in medicine helps human to live longer and enjoyed the world even more.', 'It is the outcomes of advance medical technology, changing of lifestyle and higher living standard.', 'By comparing to the past, it is a big step forward in development of medical science.', 'In economic, we can use GDP to explain the challenge, if GDP is low, it shows that most of people are living in a hard life, life quality is bad, then it will cause the terrible society problem, at last, it will happen the society disturbance.', 'Furthermore, to make livings, many senior citizens go back to work field.', 'Although the auto-tracking device is quite powerful, it still has to be used in volunteering bases.', 'It can provide a safe, convenient, identifiable environment.', 'Risks can be analyzed if there is a record of what was happened in the past.', 'With increasing age, people become more prone to disease and injury, and more difficult to recover.', 'Population ageing is a phenomenon observed exclusively in advanced civilizations.It requires at least three conditions to happen: advanced health care system, reduced hazards from the environment and the ubiquitous good will for senior citizens.', 'Some parents were too busy to take care of children while other parents did not believe what children said.', 'Rising life expectancies is also an achievement to governments.', 'Since we do not to bring cash to pay for the transportation fee, enormous time has been saved for everybody.', 'It is unavoidable for some socialists to argue that surveillance technology invade human rights, however, for the sake of whole society, surveillance technology should still be used.', \"In one way the surveillance help government guard civilians' property and life, in the other way the surveillance makes people feel uncomfortable under the 24 hours' monitoring.\", 'As to surveillance technology which is not only inefficient enough in improving our life quality but also violating our right of privacy, I think we should not use it to track people.', \"This technology are encouraged by some of the public that to implant the RFID into prisoners' body.\", 'In modern world, many global issues have been appeared like global warming, concept of earth village and population.', 'It is said that kimchi can reduce the chances of having cancer and in addition, the people will have a good skin complexion.', 'Consequently, the government is very likely to turn to be a totalitarian authority, which will be the worst scenery and tragedy for every single citizen.', 'However, although these bureaucratic actions prevent another similar attack from happening again, the act is widely criticized for its violation over individual privacy.', 'We revealed our locations, for our friends to catch up with us, however we can never know who is watching us out there secretly.', 'People are happy to see that they can finally live a long life without sacrificing their blood in battles and with more

animals which just be released from the protection of human for a long time are implanted the RFID as well to track their new life to ensure whether they could survive in the wild life.', \"With the development of science and technology, surveillance technology is playing its role in people's lifes.\", 'Government had to uninstall all the devices in the end.', 'On the other hand, when we allow surveillance technology being used to track people, it increases the successful rate of people taking bad actions.', 'At the same time, our location should be protected from seen by the strangers.', 'The rising of life expectancy globally can be challenging and yet an achievement when the problems of human could be medically disturbing.', 'It can also be found in schools and workplaces.', 'Furthermore, to make livings, many senior citizens go back to work field.', 'In the era of Warring State, warriors lose their arms or legs or even all of them.', \"With the developing of modern society, more and more new technology appears and people's life qualities rise because of the new inventions.\", 'It is responsibility of government to ensure the living of old people.', 'In the past, people only can find each other and communicate face to face.', 'Police can put tags on those that have potential intention to commit crime.', 'The best way to solve the contradiction is to educate people well and make them live an affluent life, and then the surveillance is no more needed.', 'Children can be easily found if they are lost or abducted by other people.', 'If the current quality of life has to be sustained or increase in order to keep increasing the life expectancies, it will be continue to have a huge impact on the environment.', 'If there are some controversy, how it can be improved.', 'Nowadays, the pressure from the head of a company towards those employee caused that people has to be fully concentrate in their jobs and because of that, people starts to ignore their health condition and relies on treatment and supplement.', 'Without surveillance technology, the suspicious people might actually commit a murder and the murder can be much more serious if the police cannot arrive in time to help out.', 'Compared to this disadvantage, we should think about what the advantages it has make available for human beings.', 'Overall, the benefit of these technologies overweight its problems occurred if people use it wisely.', 'In addition, for observation journeys and traveling, we only need to use RFID on some certain individuals and they will agree with this action for their own benefit.', 'Hence people died of various diseases.', 'In conclusion, what I have mentioned above, although global aging issue has become more serious on humans development, if we can balance and understand why we live.', \"At that time, Singapore government adopted the method to install surveillances in every patient's home to look after their actions.\", 'The rising life expectancies best prove these improvements and have definitely written a new chapter on the history human civilisation.', 'On the other hand, the achievement perceiving is to make comparison in the wire direction, which is comparing the current situation with the historical situation in the past.', \"Hence, as technology especially in the medical field continues to get developed and updated, people don't risk their lives anymore.\", 'In addition, elderly people are using same or even more amount of social resource, as they need more medical support and human help caused by their weaker physical status.', 'If that is true, it means that human rights and living standards are increasing in developing countries, albeit slowly.', 'The rising life expectancies are like a two side sword to the modern world.', 'Imagine there are no CCTV in public.', 'It is really a great achievement in enhancement of technology which should be recorded in history.', 'It can help regulate behaviors, prevent crime and set up demographic data base for various uses.', 'If anyone has ever read any fiction or storied written before the 18th century, it is very hard to find any character in those stories lived longer than 80 years old.', 'Ageing population is often viewed negatively by the developed countries where they are economic driven.', 'However, along with the increase of life expectancies, ageing problems becomes more and more severe.', 'With this advantage, it will be easier for people to locate his friend or his family when they lost contact or in an urgent and also for police to investigate crimes.', 'In conclusion, it is delighted to observe the fact that life expectancies are rising, but one must have the idea in mind that rising life expectancies is never easy.', 'According to news, the police force had mobilized thousand of cops, each of them prepared on duty and patrol in an allocated place all over the country and after few months, none of them was able to find Mat Selamat and rearrested him.', 'This form of tracking were also not harmful to any person where they much of these information were all used for helping a person then disrupt the lives of human race.', \"The improvement in technology also eases people's lives by replacing all the manual labourous works with easy and simple machine operative works.\", 'In conclusion, what I have mentioned above, although global aging issue has become more serious on humans development, if we can balance and understand why we live.', 'Therefore, we must encounter the challenges and be proud of the achievement to create a new life for our next generation.', 'As a result, government need more taxed from companies in order to have enough money to provide healthcare to elderly people.', 'Then there comes a problem.', 'Nowadays, this technology has been used in many kinds of fields, such as transportation and logistics, transportation payment, product tracking and inventory systems, some institutions and so on.', 'On the other hand, I think RFID can be useful when comes to appropriate handling and usage.', 'Every moves of us are easily tracked.', 'The second life expectancy is increased medical technology and sources.', 'The condition of the living environment is also improved that people are able to live in more hyginenic places.', 'Making use of our smart brain to improve our quality of life and give us more time to enjoy the life, it sounds like perfect, but we must face to the reality--there is no Utopia.', 'Although surveillance technology should not be totally abandoned, regulations of using that is expected.', 'Some supporters may argue that it will more convenient to use RFID for identification in place like airport and check point.', 'The reason why it will happen is because people have violated the natural regulation.', 'An important feature of RFID is the minimal security.', 'Also people begin to realize the importance of the environment, how to protect people from the harmful air.', 'The second one is that rising life expectancies can also be considered an achievement.', 'Without advanced health care system, aged people have higher rate of death.', 'Therefore, human need to appreciate the longer life span and consider it as an achievement.', 'In supermarkets where it is difficult to catch stealers, surveillance technology which makes records that can be replayed or detect stealers on the spot are superior to use.', 'This important information may be needed to save the person life where their medical history was all recorded in the chip.', 'After this, it can automatically get the identification and tracking.', 'If the number of old people is too much and there is lesser number of younger people, it will affect the growth of the whole society as the young workers are less, the productivity and technology improvements will be less.', 'Although rising of life expectancies is an challenge to the entire human nation, the detailed problems each country that will encounter is different.', 'It is a progress of human being that we control the world and maintain our population with longer life expectancies, but it also has potential crisis for either nation or the human being.', 'The police seize the criminal thanks to CCTV.', \"However, as the technology develops, it increased people's mobility and productivity so as life expectancies.\", 'Over these years, it had help humans to improve the accessibility in the forms of cards to gain access to certain places.', 'If the individual or family is to pay the bill, they can be bankrupted because of illness.', 'To pay this extra money, government will exert higher taxed on the other people.', 'There is only 10% of all the time of successfully pinpointed the kidnappers den and arrested all of them before they starts to harm the poor victim.', 'Back to the ancient days, when human beings firstly appeared on the earth, the average life expectancy is only less than 20.', 'As people who are incapable of production become more and more, our society follows a downward trend.', 'However, the chip implant can be retrieved out easily and replanted onto other people and so on the tag.', 'The first one is that rising life expectancies can be considered as a challenge.', 'If a society has the most advanced medical science and the best environment, but do not grant the access to them to its senior citizens, it just does not help.', 'It has been doubted that whether a society that is under close surveillance will be a good one to live in.', 'We have to consider more about our future generation, aware of the problem that over aging brought to us and come up with ideas to solve these challenges.', 'However, besides tracking goods for people, people begin to use this technology to track people.', 'In a nutshell, surveillance technology may provide a lot of convenience if being used appropriately.', 'However, the rising of life expectancies is also a challenge to the entire human nation.', 'As the standard of living increases, the affordability of high quality healthcare services and medical technologies, which have advanced over the decades, among the general public has become increasingly available.', 'Population ageing also has brought us a question on whether we should raise life expectancies, it is challenging also can get some achievement.', 'In conclusion, rising life expectancies is a challenge as it results in more potential problems for future sustainable economic development.', \"For the privacy concern, if the technology can be made to adjust to human being's feeling, it will be more welcomed.\", 'Because that the birth rate is reduced while the death rate is also reduced, the percentage of the elderly is increased while that of the youth is decreased.', 'Thus there will be a lacking in labor force, which will lead a decreasing speed of development of the country.', 'Besides, the elderly with less salary also have to lower their living standard; both the consequences can cause a decrease in social happiness level and drive the whole society in to a less stable situation.', 'It really happened in China.', 'For example, the tsunami in Tohoku of Japan in 2011 is \" the toughest and the most difficult crisis for Japan in the 65 years after the end of World War II \" as CNN commented.', \"People's lives become from increasingly convenient to almost luxury, thanks to the implementation of increasingly technology available for the Man's life.\", \"This technology are encouraged by some of the public that to implant the RFID into prisoners' body.\", 'Making use of our smart brain to improve our quality of life and give us more time to enjoy the life, it sounds like perfect, but we must face to the reality--there is no Utopia.', 'Without all this technology we may need to live in the same condition like centuries ago, with a higher death rate when diseases spread around the world and the human nations have no solution.', 'When RFID had been used in the transportation needs in the form of ez-link cards, the ability to gain faster and easier access of the transportation needs had been seen over the years.', 'In the first place, every civilized person more or less dislikes the idea that he or she is being close watched every second.', 'So more manpower will be employed, which deduces the labour in other area.', 'Sooner or later, the electric systems were short circuited as a result that the airplane was out of control and nose diving to the ground with extremely high speed.', 'A worse thing is that one may not even be aware of that he or she is being tracked.', 'This is the great achievement made by the generation.', 'The best way to solve the contradiction is to educate people well and make them live an affluent life, and then the surveillance is no more needed.', \"Every day when I opened my door and go to lady's through the corridor, I was recorded by 3 CCTV.\", 'In fact, these rising demands require a stronger working force who is active and higher productive than the past.', 'For developed countries, the challenge they face mainly are the over crowded modern cities usually face the public transportation problem and also the unevenly distributed wealth which result in that some of the population unable to benefit from the development of the human society in terms of technology which improve the life quality.', 'Studies have shown that the life span is getting longer which reflects the rising of life expectancies.', \"This gives credits to the Government's medical and healthcare schemes.\", 'With the glory, there comes problems.', 'With a doubled life time, humans can have change to explore the real meaning of life.', 'Sometimes, older need more man power and resources than normal young people.', 'However, during the process of making development to our life, we decide to reduce the rapid growth of population by adopting the measure of controlling birth so that the shortage of source allocation can also be slowed down.', \"In some very small and developed regions and countries like Singapore and Hong Kong, if people still increase the humans' life, but for these small developed regions, the resources are very limited especially land.\", \"Normal people's privacy needs government seriously considered about.\", 'Japan society is now facing severe ageing problem, and the path of development is seriously slowed.', 'People are needed.', 'All of these are human achievements in their own rights that have resulted in rising life expectancies, and hence they also illustrates why rising expectancies can be considered an achievement.', \"Many factories will be deserted and many companies will go bankruptcy, and thus people's life condition will definitely get worse.\", 'This ability is not seen 40 years back where the technology advances were not as good as now.', 'When RFID had been used in the transportation needs in the form of ez-link cards, the ability to gain faster and easier access of the transportation needs had been seen over the years.', 'On one hand, if there are less young people and more old people, lacking work force problem will arise.', 'It is very hard to understand such a feeling as people felt in the past.', 'In some kindergartens, the RFID is used to tab the children to keep a record of their attendance and whereabouts.', 'In such a situation, the society can develop in a harmonious and healthy way.', \"It basically served to allocate your iphone's position at any single time, For instance, if someone left his phone in a certain place, he can check his phone's location by searching through the internet using another phone that has the same application if you are connected with your friends' device.\", \"Every day when I opened my door and go to lady's through the corridor, I was recorded by 3 CCTV.\", 'To conclude, the population ageing phenomenon indeed shows our big achievement on economy, medical skills and living standard.', 'We also do not want to see the happening of worst things that parents are dropped by children along the streets and let them die themselves.', 'So rising life expectancies will make the world population larger, more people shall the limited resources.', 'However, since the space and resource on earth is very limited, higher life expectancy means more people will live on the earth at the same time and more fierce competition for food and space is unavoidable.', \"Normal people's privacy needs government seriously considered about.\", 'Over these years, it had help humans to improve the accessibility in the forms of cards to gain access to certain places.', 'To purchase goods, they just need to deduce money from their identity and make a transition of money to the one who is selling the goods.', 'With the help of RFID, if there is an urgent that people crying for help, they would be saved.', 'To sum up, with rising life expectancies, there exist both achievement and challenge.', 'Probably the next breakthrough is around the corner in the near future.', 'However, when surveillance technology starts to violet the privacy of people instead of being used in a more benefitial way towards people, it is my opinion, that, such technology should rethink its way of existence.', 'By law, citizens have the rights to keep their privacy unknow to public, whereas the privacy would be exposed if such surveillance technology is applied widely.', 'In some fields, Surveillance technology did have brought us tremendous benefit and advantage.', 'Since there are more people on the earth, more space is needed for people to live in, so that some farming land might be turned into buildings to accommodate more people.', 'By using this technology reasonably, it will assist people to walk faster and further in the long and rough civilization developing path.', 'Thus there will be a lacking in labor force, which will lead a decreasing speed of development of the country.', 'And after all this scientific research result is applied to daily life, products such as RFID tracking system have become real.', 'In conclutin, the rising life expectancies can be considered both challenge and achievement.', 'The benefits of the surveillance are obvious in the fighting of SARS, and this is a success example of the surveillance.', \"In order to bring more benefit and ensure people's safety, surveillance technology has been utilized in many aspects of fields like in UPs and DHL, these express delivery companies use surveillance technology to track their goods.\", 'Soon after coming into the industrial age, human released the weapon and brings up a new technologic era.', 'Other than using it on these areas, it is also been used as human implant or as a form of products.', 'For example, if the one who carry the identifiable sensor does not want any other to know his or her location, he or she can disable the track.', 'All in all, surveillance technology such as RFID should not be used to track general population for the violation of privacy, the trend to misuse such measures and the enhancement of the totalitarian power of the authority.', 'Also, the population ageing calls for a higher standard of medical treatment and technology, higher level of civilization of our life.', 'As our society develops, the people have a much higher living standard, which will reduce the chance of getting disease.', 'Imagine there are no CCTV in public.', 'The contradiction of the safety and the privacy cannot be reconciled perfectly.', 'Although someone would say the information is secured very well and will not be released or misused by any purpose, it is still not appropriate.', 'Nevertheless, the activities I mentioned above are related little to privacy issues.', 'Although current world is a digital world which more machines are used to replace manpower, manpower is required to operating these machines so that they can better functioned.', 'With more perfect system with the old and more modern equipment, population ageing always comes first.', 'However, among the under-developed countries, developing countries and developed countries, we found that there is longest life span in the developed countries follows by the developing countries and the shortest life span in under-developed countries.', 'This also works and we have also seen the effect.', 'Secondly, for the older people, more facilities and service for them should be provided.', \"People's lives become from increasingly convenient to almost luxury, thanks to the implementation of increasingly technology available for the Man's life.\", 'If failed to fulfil this requirement, this will lead to more financial strains such as increased tax imposed on the societal or company working groups.', 'Finally, the company tracking system has no meaning at all, therefore tracking system is very terrible measure to control people.', 'However, the health level of world population shows an increasing trend due to advancing medical technology and it leads to exponential growth in number of elders worldwide.', \"Maybe that's one reason for the reducing of the birth rate.\", 'From another perspective, there are more and more elder people but less younger ones, the increase in population age has weaken the labor force and so on.', 'If such thing does happen, then the society would be moving on a dangerous direction without being noticed.', 'Therefore, this technology carries great risk when we can only see the advantages that has been appeared.', 'One of the examples is the storage of bank account number in the tracking chip.', 'Still the possible downfall of these surveillance technologies is too present in my paranoid mind and they clearly overweight the benefits, in my opinion.', 'No matter how good and how many security systems are there for us, the hackers are also increasingly improving their skills in terms of hacking and breaking the codes of the security system.', 'These kind of situation will cause crime as thieves may auto track you and you are not able to run out of them.', 'The reason why the life expectancies have aroused is that we are becoming more and more clever due to the evolution, and we are becoming richer and richer due to the knowledge we have learned.', \"This may lead to the younger's lower employment rate and opportunities and thus they have to live with huge pressure and lower living standard to reduce the daily cost.\", 'With the population ageing problem getting more and more serious all over the world, the shortage of various kind of resources challenge most of the countries in the world.', 'Additionally, the service industry were also using it to track its clothes that were been used by their employees.', 'On medicine, people have done a lot of researches on life science.', 'The number and types of illness also increases relative to the age too.', 'However, when we look at the brighter side of the reality, the rise in life expectancy proves great improvements in various realms and solved many problems we had in the past, there is hope that the aging population may transform into helpful force to a country in the future with the help of better technology and medication.', 'Not only the details of location will be provided, but also may lead to find out the root of this kind of children trading agency and it helps to prevent more this kind of tragedy to happen on any family.', 'First, if the older people increase, there will be fewer workforces that can support the society.', 'There are so many people in FBI, although it is under strict rule, and we cannot think ideally there will not be any one abuse its power and access those resources for private purpose and lease them out.', 'This form of tools does not harm but it helps in the ability to identify any person who is not carrying any identification when comes to emergency.', 'Besides financial burdens, they may also need to spend more energy to take care of them.', 'If developed health care system is increasing the positive side, it would be also helpful to reduce the negative side, which including reducing the hazards from the environment.', 'Studies have shown that the average life span or human being rising gradually over years, in the sense that the improvement of global technology in medicine helps human to live longer and enjoyed the world even more.', 'Ageing population is a consequence of increasing health level of population.', 'During the work, supervisor usually asks the so called \" old staff\\' to lead the newbie.', 'The super markets are also using this technology to tag their product, which can record the conditions of all of the products in time and prevent of stealing.', 'By projections of the United Nations, it is shown that population aged more than 60 is increasing at 2% to 3% in the developed and developing countries respectively.', 'Radio-frequency identification is a technology which uses a wireless non-contact system to scan and transfer the data from a tag attached to people or products with radio-frequency electromagnetic field.', 'They will be more vulnerable to be hurt or get some injures.', 'Hence, the country will face a big challenge as to take care of the elderly.', 'In modern world, many global issues have been appeared like global warming, concept of earth village and population.', 'However, in countries like China, where there is no law to force people to chain their pets, pets are usually left unchained and run freely on the streets.', 'However, the dark side of using surveillance technology is that it results in the invasion of privacy.', 'However, as the population is ageing, the challenges such as increased medical cost and shortage of workforce are also realized.', \"In general, surveillance technology benefits the society and should be applied with the consideration of individuals' life.\", 'Where every home houses an elderly, the future generations can learn and carry on their traditional and morale values.', 'Since this may happen across province, and without any clue about the path that the child may went through.', 'We cannot give up what we achieved in the past and follow the natural way die and reborn.', 'Compared to this disadvantage, we should think about what the advantages it has make available for human beings.', 'It is undeniable that technology has made ours lives and works easier and more efficient.', 'Every moves of us are easily tracked.', 'This form of tools does not harm but it helps in the ability to identify any person who is not carrying any identification when comes to emergency.', 'Perhaps that the surveillance is installed for the sake of safety, but actually it conversely make us have a lack of safety.', 'Example of this technology is RFID (radio-frequency identification) which has been proposed to track people through various means such as human implants or RFID tags on people.', \"For example, thieves can easily find out the best time to visit our houses and kidnappers can take away our kids every time if they are informed of everyone's location.\", 'It is unavoidable for some socialists to argue that surveillance technology invade human rights, however, for the sake of whole society, surveillance technology should still be used.', \"Their opinion is based on the children safety protection and parents' guardian.\", 'As this information is been well keep by the operators where they encrypt the data and used it in the proper form.', 'Their lives are becoming meaningless and a lot of them had chosen to suicide without giving troubles to the others.', 'Some parents were too busy to take care of children while other parents did not believe what children said.', 'There is a Chinese saying that goes, \" Jia you yi lao, ru you yi bao \".', 'Instead, when news of the installment of such device was released on the newspaper, it was heavily cricised by the public.', 'Maybe, it is because the modern society is become more and more competitive, the parents are paying much attention and importance to their career.', 'It is unavoidable for some socialists to argue that surveillance technology invade human rights, however, for the sake of whole society, surveillance technology should still be used.', 'Imagine when people camping in forest or hills, they will just lost all of the internet signal and also a risk that their phone running out of batteries.', 'Firstly, the aging population is generally of low productivity.', 'Afterall there will be an endless battle between the technology and human mentality.', 'To extend our life is not only a symbol of our achievement in developing our society, but also a fulfillment of our original dream.', 'We should separate it into two aspects.', 'Fewer young people and more elder people are existed globally.', 'Therefore, population ageing should be considered both a challenge and an achievement.', 'Only if it be made use in a wise and sensible approach and be adjusted and refined very profoundly, can it bring us the maximized benefit.', 'We need CCTV in every public corner to track suspicious.', 'More challenges also include the environment challenges that are seen over the years.', 'Fewer young people and more elder people are existed globally.', 'That is to say, people will be surveilled for every moment without awareness.', 'Although we all understand the installing of CCTV is used for protect us from criminal, nowadays, it seems to be abused too much.', 'How to explain this problem, it means that people are not sure who are in charge of these tracking system.', 'After going through the WW1 and WW2, the population on the earth got much fewer.', 'It shows that significant case of the important of experience.', 'Studies have shown that the average life span or human being rising gradually over years, in the sense that the improvement of global technology in medicine helps human to live longer and enjoyed the world even more.', 'On one side, we can use it to ensure that something is under our control to reduce the rate of crimes.', 'During the less developed times, due to disasters like droughts ,floods or severe contagious disease like black deaths, people at that time could lose their property and lives easily since they do not have enough power to protect themselves and restore their life in a short time.', 'While it is applaudable that people achieved great success in prolonging their lives, there are social challenges posted by the rising life expectancies.', 'Some people think RFID should be banned out of privacy consideration.', 'However, whether a behavior is a crime is dependent on the authority.', 'It is a natural rule that when people grow older, their bodies will be less flexible and brains will operate slower, so they will contribute less to the society.', 'Approval of RFID tracking will be seen as a violation of human rights and people will lose their most basic freedom.', 'Moreover, the increased technologies help people to overcome different natural disasters.', \"Thus, the rising expectancies actually reflect the increasing stability and comfort of people's life and indirectly reflecting the ability of government to provide people of their current comforts, economical statues, convenience and others.\", 'Besides tags into human body, there is also the issue of implant into products.', 'There are many factors which will result in the death of people, such as natural disasters, accident, diseases or suicides.', 'If the above two aspects are described as the hardwares of the system, they do require a software to function, which is the ubiquitous good will for senior citizens.', \"This is due to the improvements and breakthroughs in the realm of medication and people's

opportunity on this marvelous tracking technology.', 'This was supposed to be applauded by the public because it allowed fast searching on people who violated the law and caused harm to others.', 'We should image that when the life expectancies are raised up; this will mean that the average age for the population in nation wise or globally is also rising.', 'In the first place, rising life expectancies could cause resources challenge.', 'Once cancers are too late to discovered, one is deemed to death at a later stage.', 'Rising life expectancies is an achievement because it is an evidence of progress of modern medical technology and meanwhile it is a challenge because it can incur the problem of lacking work force or too large population.', 'The most controversial part may be the human identification.', 'Besides that, ageing population has an important and essential thing that we cannot buy in cash.', 'When I work, it seems I am holding my heart working since if I am doing something wrong or relax in working time.', 'For society, when the group of old people becomes larger and less people can work for the society, this society may lack of labours.', 'Patients in many

front of ATM we need monitor to avoid intentional crime.', 'Ageing population is often viewed negatively by the developed countries where they are economic driven.', 'For instance, a company has over two hundred employees scattered over different locations in Singapore, and is currently keeping tracking of working hours and overtime payments through the use of a punch card system-a system which can be open to abuses such as an employee punching the card for another.', 'In another a word, people will feel that the boss or the company treats them like goods, because modern people need more

people system may be used by bad people in a wrong way.', \"However, some of the non-governmental organizations show their point of view that object and resist implanting the RFID into prisoners' body.\", 'However, people who are taking security job assert that surveillance technology is the most effective way to track people and make it easier for them to track those suspicious people so that they can do their work much more effectively.', 'On one side, we can use it to ensure that something is under our control to reduce the rate of crimes.', 'In the transportation, almost all of the people have transport cards for daily transport.', 'The reason why it will happen is because people have violated the natural regulation.', 'I do not agree on this argument that surveillance technology should not be used to track people.', 'This is the interpretation of challenge for rising life expectancies.', 'Secondly, for the older people, more facilities and service for them should be provided.', 'Nowadays, people need to carry a lot of ID cards around to show that I am the one the same as the one on the ID cards.', 'In my opinion, I think we should study balance it well, one side we should continue to make efforts to raise the humans life, one side, we should consider using asking some sick old men whether if they want to take euthanasia.', 'Government should help encourage the breakthroughs as well as complete medication system.', 'With good communication and interaction, an elderly can guide the young with valuable lessons in life.', 'The rising of life expectancies is not only an achievement, but also a great challenge.', 'Although current world is a digital world which more machines are used to replace manpower, manpower is required to operating these machines so that they can better functioned.', \"As the technology increasingly advances, many of things that are regarded as impossible are turning into the 'possibles'.\", 'Government will be burdened by the growing aging population as well because it needs to set aside a great amount of money to provide better welfare of the old people because they are in urgent need of it.', 'Since people get higher education today, increasing amounts of people switch from fast food to organic food and have a balanced diet so that their chance of getting cancer is lowered.', 'Since this is happen more often in the country which is much larger than Singapore, it is even harder or maybe it is impossible for the parents to find the child back without knowing where the child has been brought to.', 'Rising life expectancies can be a pro to family affairs.', 'If developed health care system is increasing the positive side, it would be also helpful to reduce the negative side, which including reducing the hazards from the environment.', 'However, not many young people are passionate about helping the society or even helping the elderly.', 'In the past, people only can find each other and communicate face to face.', 'This was supposed to be applauded by the public because it allowed fast searching on people who violated the law and caused harm to others.', 'Probably the next breakthrough is around the corner in the near future.', 'The rising of life expectancy globally can be challenging and yet an achievement when the problems of human could be medically disturbing.', 'Eating the right amount of healthy or junk food can be a cause of having a longer or shorter lifespan.', 'In conclusion, the reason why population ageing is increasing majority is due to the great improvement of the global medical science.', 'Therefore, when the era is improving itself, the disease does it too.', 'Afterall, it might seem difficult to handle when the aging population of a country grows, especially the developed countries with very small population.', 'Ageing population is a prolonged and persistent societal problem that is being frowned upon in most of the developed countries.', 'So rising life expectancies will make the world population larger, more people shall the limited resources.', 'The technology is based on the chip implant or tag.', 'It is the technology developments enable the improvement of the living condition; the discover of the food and the nutrition that is more suitable and more necessary for human to absorb; the various medicines that can be used to cure different diseases.', 'In addition, old people are weakened in many aspects, thus they are usually not considered as labors.', 'Then why would they agree to put themselves into those societies?', 'After going through the WW1 and WW2, the population on the earth got much fewer.', 'It is deniable that population ageing can cause a lot of problems, but in the same time, it is also a symbol of improvement.', 'It is deniable that population ageing can cause a lot of problems, but in the same time, it is also a symbol of improvement.', 'For an example, one would like to have I-Phone 5 in the past but he or she will expect it to have more functions or operate in faster speed after using it a while.', 'In modern digital world, electronic products are widely used in daily lives such as Smart phones, computers and etc.', 'Besides, as the development of the technology, the medical therapy also has a tremendous progress.', 'For example, making ordinary people not allowed to use that and do not let the surveillance device accessible to the ordinary people so that abuse usage of surveillance technology can be avoided, which is also a effective way to protect human right.', 'Whereas, for the sustainable development of the country and the earth, some measurements and policies should be carried out to control and change this phenomenon.', 'With the help of the video surveillance, the chances of people performing crimes can be decreased.', 'The rising life expectancies may be due to several different reasons, for example, it may be because of the improvement of the living condition, or because of the upgrade of the cleanness of the living environment, or because of the wide arrange of nutrition that absorbed by the human, or because of the development of the medication system in the country.', 'However, with respect of civil rights and privacy, surveillance technology such as RFID (radio-frequency identification) shall not be used to track people.', 'In addition, old people are weakened in many aspects, thus they are usually not considered as labors.', 'It is understandable that once people have human implants, they may start to behave themselves because they can be easily traced out.', 'An even larger share of the old people expense lies in the health care.', 'Therefore, surveillance technology can be used but the use of surveillance should be modified in such a way that individuals are less affected in normal life.', 'Health caring by far has been expensive to carry out.', 'We should image that when the life expectancies are raised up; this will mean that the average age for the population in nation wise or globally is also rising.', 'With increasing age, people become more prone to disease and injury, and more difficult to recover.', 'Technology advancement is extremely fast nowadays.', 'Additionally, if appropriately used, this device can contributed to our scientific findings and research.', 'After a country was just founded, some immature policy leaded to a nationwide hunger.', 'The advanced technology has helped us to live longer, but the limited resource on earth is also a big challenge.', \"Life expectancy can be defined as desired level of service or better technology to make one's life more comfortable.\", 'As to surveillance technology which is not only inefficient enough in improving our life quality but also violating our right of privacy, I think we should not use it to track people.', 'It probably can be divided into several types.', 'Therefore, surveillance technology makes our society more ordered.', 'It is the technology developments enable the improvement of the living condition; the discover of the food and the nutrition that is more suitable and more necessary for human to absorb; the various medicines that can be used to cure different diseases.', 'More elderly people are a burden to the society as more funds are required by the governments to support their standard of living.', 'If developed health care system is increasing the positive side, it would be also helpful to reduce the negative side, which including reducing the hazards from the environment.', 'In general trend, elderly people are easy to be ill as compared to young capable adults.', 'Rising life expectancies can bring us more skilled work force because we can delay the retirement time to extend working time for each person.', 'And all the evidences have been collected by hidden surveillance when he though he was expressing his opinion in the safe house!', 'Everyday crimes are happening from time to time, and help to keep low criminal rate can be a combo of ethical, physiological and social problems.', 'Large quantities of energy are needed for the pesticides, and to harvest and transport the food produces around the globe.', 'In addition, elderly people are using same or even more amount of social resource, as they need more medical support and human help caused by their weaker physical status.', 'However developed our society is, Technology should always serve us as a tool instead of constraining us like ropes.', 'With the strong back support of technology, the rises of life expectancies can be seen as an achievement to the development of our human society.', 'It functions to track the path of animals and help in scientific research.', 'Although some countries in Africa and Southeast Asia still face a lack of medical insurance, the world in all is getting better in the field.', 'Also, the growing percentage of older people will cause the maintenance of many traditional thoughts and mindsets which may become a resistance of the positive social change.', 'Now in Singapore, we can feel that there are more old people than young people if you go to Chinatown.', 'For the second part, rising life expectancies is also an achievement.', 'After a country was just founded, some immature policy leaded to a nationwide hunger.', 'Subsequently, a lot of problems regarding to it are arising.', 'The concurrent result is increasing size of population.', 'However, as the energy and resources use up, more and more adult people without sufficient power to produce crowd on earth will aggravate the ageing problem, so the rise of life expectancies can also be seen as a challenge.', 'Cars and trucks diminish the redundancy of long time shipment.', 'For an example, one would like to have I-Phone 5 in the past but he or she will expect it to have more functions or operate in faster speed after using it a while.', 'With the ageing population, many countries are facing the same challenge as to build safety houses, facilities to cater to the old aged.', 'It shows that significant case of the important of experience.', 'If the current quality of life has to be sustained or increase in order to keep increasing the life expectancies, it will be continue to have a huge impact on the environment.', 'In a word, the rising in life expectancy is both an achievement and a challenge for the whole human beings.', 'It also indicates that the economy has been dramatically grown.', 'Rising life expectancies can be a pro to family affairs.', 'Economics can take advantage of these figures to predict the economic trend of local as well as the whole country.', 'Life expectancies rise significantly from the past to recent in the whole world.', 'Besides, we can try to reduce the bad effect cause by the new technology.', 'Compare the technology today and the past, we can see that a lot of deceases are treatable, the number of people that died because of the deceases that is not treatable decreases.', 'Surveillance technology will help to prevent the family to loss their member especially the elderly and the children which need to be pay more attention to.', 'For developing countries, they may encounter more about the shortage of food resources and and the problem of how to develop better medication system to serve the entire nation, and they also face the problem of how to distribute the wealth evenly to benefit the entire population, more over they need to consider carefully how to build the education system so that the next generation of the population will be able to carry on to raise the whole country.', 'Secondly, the tracking proposal will raise a safety issue.', 'Rising life expectancies can be a challenge.', 'Soon after coming into the industrial age, human released the weapon and brings up a new technologic era.', 'With the moral of filial, most of the children will take care of their parents after their retirement life.', 'In supermarket monitor is needed because we have to track thieves.', 'When not using it, just switch off the card, then it will be just a useless paper.', 'For developing countries, they may encounter more about the shortage of food resources and and the problem of how to develop better medication system to serve the entire nation, and they also face the problem of how

humans who used their time to help most people improve our basic needs and life for the living and extension of our life expectancy.', 'In the old times, people could easily lose their life due to hunger, disease, government, war or something else.', 'Here, red thing means marriage and white means someone passing away.', 'For example, there are always news on newspaper, report that some elderly get lost at certain place and their family are looking for him or her.', 'With advanced medical technology, not only many diseases can be cured, but also people know how to keep themselves healthy.', 'Rising life expectancy is also an achievement.', 'In the developed countries like Japan and Switzerland, the life expectancy can be as high as more than 80.', 'With the help of RFID, if there is an urgent that people crying for help, they would be saved.', 'Actually, not only for scientific observations but also during adventure journeys or travelling, RFID can defend human beings from harm.', 'This tracking will help scientists to better get their result and clear exploration route information will also be useful for post-research when scientists come back.', 'From the view of my point, I think the application should only be authorized by people in some specific fields like politics and public security.', 'However, the consumer may not be aware of the function of the tag, so this action could reveal the sensitive information of the consumers like home address, working address to someone who is not authorized to get the information.', 'Ageing population requires more medical sources since elders needs more medical attention.', 'Population ageing: A more and more attention-getting topic', 'Development of technology is making our life easier and more comfortable.', 'Normally, people will regard the extended life expectation as an achievement, and usually use such data as a measure of the development of the countries.', 'And he spends 1000 dollars to install the surveillance system in his house.', 'At the same time more people are needed to take care of the old ones, which gives the younger generation extra works.', \"Without doubt, surveillance technology is going against the right since it leaks out people's information without getting their permission.\", 'Compare the technology today and the past, we can see that a lot of deceases are treatable, the number of people that died because of the deceases that is not treatable decreases.', 'We have to admit that how to prevent the abuse and how to use it reasonably depend on a sound legal system, and it means surveillance has its own restriction.', 'In case, they have some accident like heart attack, the track of them will show there is something wrong.', 'People fell into panic when they knew that they had lost the harmony and peace in their country and the government had no choice but keep claiming that their country is still in safety mode.', 'Otherwise, the comfort level of life will be maintained or lowered down when the time passes or people should lower their expectancies of life.', 'The challenge will be increase the quality of life while being environmentally sustainable.', 'Moreover, achieving the near impossible to eliminate all the illness such as cancer and diseases is the greatest achievement for human race.', 'Imagine when people camping in forest or hills, they will just lost all of the internet signal and also a risk that their phone running out of batteries.', 'Furthermore, to make livings, many senior citizens go back to work field.', 'In the other words, it also can be said that it is an achievement to obtain an ageing population.', 'Today, the surveillance technology has become almost manifest to wherever we go.', 'And that is what we are striving for.', 'Because of the surveillance technology, more and more things are under track and more and more clues can be used.', 'They pull up the age to retire.', 'In addition, the national defense will be endangered if this tracking proposal is launched.', 'For developed countries, the challenge they face mainly are the over crowded modern cities usually face the public transportation problem and also the unevenly distributed wealth which result in that some of the population unable to benefit from the development of the human society in terms of technology which improve the life quality.', 'By investigating the track by the surveillance technology, they can easily figure out where are their kids now and know roughly what they are doing.', 'This tracking proposal creates a loophole in the net of justice rather than its original purpose.', 'When these scholars are on the field journey, they also have to relate their observation with their route information; this is when RFID is of great significance.', 'This will make the logistic process more effective and also prevent the occurrence of product lost because of the tracking.', 'This form of tools does not harm but it helps in the ability to identify any person who is not carrying any identification when comes to emergency.', 'For the society, there will be a more efficient transportation system.', 'One of the basic rights

the earth, pollution might become even serious, and as a result of pollution, the supply of food and water will decrease, so that a negative loop will occur and the problem becomes even harder to solve.', 'Many advantages have been shown in the areas like politics.', 'Then we can see that the rising life expectancies can also be viewed as a challenge for us to face.', 'In this essay, I will discuss that if surveillance technology such as RFID (radio-frequency identification) should be used or not to track people.', 'That is to say, people will be surveilled for every moment without awareness.', 'This will inversely improve the sale of the shop.', 'There exist various advantages of using the surveillance technology.', 'It may be a help to prevent potential crimes from happening

think that surveilence technology should not be allowed to be used to track people.', \"However, I think such powerful device shall not be made easily available for the public or fall into the hands of 'ill-intentioned' individuals.\", 'However, the health level of world population shows an increasing trend due to advancing medical technology and it leads to exponential growth in number of elders

good for the children, however children also have the human rights and privacy which is endanger under this technology.', 'There has been a report estimated that at the year 2060, only half of the population in Japan are suitable to work.', 'With increasing age, people become more prone to disease and injury, and more difficult to recover.', 'In this paper, the incorrectness of using technology such as RFID to track people will be proved by the discussion of violation of privacy, the trend to misuse such measures and the enhancement of the totalitarian rule of the authority.', 'Every moves of us are being closely surveilled and followed once we stepped out of homes.', 'The first time when I read this saying I am confused why someone passing away is a good thing that people should celebrate and later I was told that in past, it is hard to live longer than 60 years old and even though you are very lucky to live longer than 60 years old, you will suffer a lot from illness or the sadness for your young relatives passing away, so people think it is worth celebrating since they will not suffer any longer.', 'So according to the humanism, people should make contribution to rising the humans life, because people should consider the feelings if one day when you are becoming older and older, so respecting life should be considered carefully.', 'In case, they have some accident like heart attack, the track of them will show there is something wrong.', 'These changes and damages also increase the chances of contacting more illness as we age.', 'There has been a report estimated that at the year 2060, only half of the population in Japan are suitable to work.', 'In addition, old people are weakened in many aspects, thus they are usually not considered as labors.', 'However, as there are only limited space and resource on earth, rising life expectancy is also a challenge for all the people worldwide.', 'In the past, when people injured or fall into sickness, there is no guarantee that the people will get well treatment and fully recovered, therefore people can easily die by infected of a small disease.', 'The libraries also use this technology to identify the membership of the people entering, which ensures the security and the member itself will also conserve their information made in this library.', 'However, this proposal has led to fierce argument in the world over its pros and cons.', 'If that technology is abandoned, it may trigger more bad people to commit murder or stole things since it is very difficult for the police to track them and they have a high possibility of not being punished by the law.', 'They have a full control of their own lives.', 'Economics can take advantage of these figures to predict the economic trend of local as well as the whole country.', 'Surveillance technology can be used to detect very risky events and prevent its happening in the future, hence to save more lives.', 'Some people think RFID should be banned out of privacy consideration.', 'For example, they encourage people to have more children by awarding them.', 'Humanity can be best seen in the case of pets rearing.', \"In the first case, RFID can be used to help parents to surveillance their children so that they can make sure if they are at school or playing around at his friends' home, and this may help parents regulate their children's behavior.\", 'In last two centuries, we human have made the greatest achievement in developing our society.', 'For example, there are always news on newspaper, report that some elderly get lost at certain place and their family are looking for him or her.', \"For individuals, since people's life expectancies are becoming longer, there will be more troubles for them to take care of themselves, especially for those who live alone or have diseases and are poor.\", 'People in current era are described as demanding or having high level of life expectancies in another word.', 'An even larger share of the old people expense lies in the health care.', 'Not Being Imprisoned by Surveillance Technology', 'If the current quality of life has to be sustained or increase in order to keep increasing the life expectancies, it will be continue to have a huge impact on the environment.', 'In conclusion, I think that surveilence technology should not be allowed to be used to track people.', \"People's lives become from increasingly convenient to almost luxury, thanks to the implementation of increasingly technology available for the Man's life.\", 'More importantly, they can share their ideas of how to keep healthy through Internet, to make more interested people get involve and find ways to make life longer and more wonderful.', 'There are so many people in FBI, although it is under strict rule, and we cannot think ideally there will not be any one abuse its power and access those resources for private purpose and lease them out.', 'This activity can be marked as the start of the first technology revolution.', 'That is the natural law which nobody can violate.', 'People fell into panic when they knew that they had lost the harmony and peace in their country and the government had no choice but keep claiming that their country is still in safety mode.', 'There are so many people in FBI, although it is under strict rule, and we cannot think ideally there will not be any one abuse its power and access those resources for private purpose and lease them out.', 'If the above two aspects are described as the hardwares of the system, they do require a software to function, which is the ubiquitous good will for senior citizens.', 'It is the technology developments enable the improvement of the living condition; the discover of the food and the nutrition that is more suitable and more necessary for human to absorb; the various medicines that can be used to cure different diseases.', 'This could cause a drastic fall in their economy as if the younger generation could not take over their work, no one will continue.', 'For developed countries, the challenge they face mainly are the over crowded modern cities usually face the public transportation problem and also the unevenly distributed wealth which result in that some of the population unable to benefit from the development of the human society in terms of technology which improve the life quality.', 'Rising expectancies is also an environmental challenge because a better quality of life requires a lot of energy.', 'It is also the advance of surveillance technology.', 'For example, it becomes hard for them to earn their livings; they may feel lonely especially if their spouses died; they may suffer from all kinds of diseases.', 'What we can do now is to try hard to solve the problems and in the same time appreciate its great meanings.', 'Illustrations that is both hypothetical and yet concrete are action spy movies, such as the Bourne identity.', 'If the surveillance technology is abandoned, it makes the police very difficult to track the suspicious people and can have little control of those people who are dangerous to the society.', 'Studies have shown that the life span is getting longer which reflects the rising of life expectancies.', 'The technology is necessary because it can provide evidence in crime investigation and social issues and decrease the illegal actions effectively.', \"We should respect that everyone has human rights and without other's permission, this should not be placed or implanted to anyone.\", 'All in all, surveillance technology such as RFID should not be used to track general population for the violation of privacy, the trend to misuse such measures and the enhancement of the totalitarian power of the authority.', 'Health caring by far has been expensive to carry out.', 'Despite the challenges from ageing population, it is an achievement as less people are in competency to bid for one job position.', 'Mischief cases could actually cause a chaos on the checkpoint tracking record and a more serious issue if people do it ill-intentionally.', 'Then, the person is able to use GPS or other auto-tracking device to find the place even he has never gone to there before.', 'After they release from the prison, the movement of their whole life is controlled and known by the government.', 'There is no a doubt, tracking system has brought many benefits in this information age.', 'Hence, when the ratio of the seniors whose age is above 60 reaches some certain point, the challenge to the society cannot be neglect anymore.', 'However, as life expectancy rises, some social challenges occurred as well.', 'However, the growing life expectancies also mean an achievement to the human society.', 'Around people, there are full of high technology like CCTVs, automatically sorting system for goods and different information systems.', 'There is the experience in life time.', \"In one way the surveillance help government guard civilians' property and life, in the other way the surveillance makes people feel uncomfortable under the 24 hours' monitoring.\", 'Since people get higher education today, increasing amounts of people switch from fast food to organic food and have a balanced diet so that their chance of getting cancer is lowered.', 'There is a truth that we cannot deny which is that surveillance technology can provide a sense of safety because sometimes machine is more honest than people.', 'In a Chinese kindergarten, Children were always abused by a teacher but no one else knows that.', 'Take Singapore for example, these are installed from highly secured places such as Government sectors to working places, from condominiums to housing development board houses, and even from school canteens to toilets!', 'Surprisingly, none of these are describing the future as a bright one.', 'If a society has the most advanced medical science and the best environment, but do not grant the access to them to its senior citizens, it just does not help.', 'It is a progress of human being that we control the world and maintain our population with longer life expectancies, but it also has potential crisis for either nation or the human being.', \"In the reality, people are afraid of being tracking everywhere, not because of meaning to crime, but the spirit of freedom and privacy is in everyone's heart.\", 'How to explain this problem, it means that people are not sure who are in charge of these tracking system.', 'I agree that RFID technology shall not be made available to the public for easy abuse and distorted usage.', 'On the other side, the technology can also be probably used by the lawbreader to commit crimes.', 'Therefore, the only way available for us to destroy such a balance is accelerating the progress of development so to increase the capacity of our planet.', 'People are able to predicate some disasters like the earth quake and do the prevention beforehand.', 'This shows the rising of life expectancies, it is an achievement and it is also a challenge.', 'Such technology would put people into the same circumstance as those pupils where the government plays the role of parents trying to find out whatever people are doing every second.', 'Few years ago, there was a jailbreaker named Mat Selamat, one of the members of the terrorists of Osama, successfully escaped under the monitoring of a couple of cops in Singapore.', 'There are a series of problems that hinders longevity such as current medication.', 'Only if it be made use in a wise and sensible approach and be adjusted and refined very profoundly, can it bring us the maximized benefit.', 'Such situation is a major progress from the ancient time and also a big achievement by all human beings.', 'The objective truth in CCTV is helpful and efficient in crime investigation, better than asking witness again and again to identify who is the liar.', 'When a husband is talking a sweet sentence to his wife, none of the couple want it to be heard by the people behind the monitors.', 'Finally, the company tracking system has no meaning at all, therefore tracking system is very terrible measure to control people.', 'On one side, we cannot deny that it is a great achievement with the rising life expectancies.', 'As this information is been well keep by the operators where they encrypt the data and used it in the proper form.', 'After finding and analyzing the black box of the Valujet after the incidence, police investigators found out reasons for causing this severe incidence.', 'Now, technology and science develops at an unbelievably fast pace.', 'Long life span for the individual himself is a great achievement which indicates he or she is brave enough to face the life full of problems.', 'We can either step back to maintain the population with some method, or step forward to search for more resources in outer space.', 'For example, one person wants to visit his friends place in a new city.', 'Nowadays, this technology has been used in many kinds of fields, such as transportation and logistics, transportation payment, product tracking and inventory systems, some institutions and so on.', 'Pets are supposed to be chained when they are out on the streets.', 'However, if nothing happened inside his house, then the surveillance becomes useless, and he will also feel very uncomfortable because his every move is being supervised.', 'In summary, the rising average life span is both a challenge and an achievement because it means the increase of the load and the advance of society, including at least advaced advanced health care system, reduced hazards from the environment and the ubiquitous good will for senior citizens, at the same time.', 'Firstly, the population ageing can be definitely viewed as an improvement of human culture and technology.', 'When the percentage of old people grows larger in the population, the labor is considered to become less and each labor need to pay more on the welfare of the old people.', 'Also tracking people is very dangerous if it has been controlled by bad men in a not good purpose.', 'Less money will be left to develop the country and explore into new areas of business.', 'Approval of RFID tracking will be seen as a violation of human rights and people will lose their most basic freedom.', 'This will make the logistic process more effective and also prevent the occurrence of product lost because of the tracking.', 'However, there are both sides of stories.', 'Additionally, the service industry were also using it to track its clothes that were been used by their employees.', 'Population ageing is not all about the good side of the society though.', 'For families, certainly, the burden for young people is becomes heavier.', 'There is only 10% of all the time of successfully pinpointed the kidnappers den and arrested all of them before they starts to harm the poor victim.', 'Reality kills people in mind.', 'However, RFID will violate our right of privacy during our shopping activities.', 'People nowadays would agree that it is terrible to live in those societies.', 'In the first place, every civilized person more or less dislikes the idea that he or she is being close watched every second.', 'As you can see, there are quite a lot of advantages of using the surveillance technology to track people.', 'After the invention of phone and internet, there are more ways to use to communicate with people and even track people.', 'As the amount of stress, the types of food mixed with chemicals and the quality of living in terms of environment were getting worst.', 'In case, they have some accident like heart attack, the track of them will show there is something wrong.', 'Besides that, ageing population has an important and essential thing that we cannot buy in cash.', 'In fact, these rising demands require a stronger working force who is active and higher productive than the past.', 'They can live longer as they can afford high healthcare fares to maintain their health to a better condition.', 'And after all this scientific research result is applied to daily life, products such as RFID tracking system have become real.', 'To summary, we respect every life, also help people to live longer.', 'No matter where people go, taking bus or MRT, people are under the CCTVs, it is very important and useful to track and find people.', 'Apart from diseases themselves, deficiency of medication system coverage and inefficiency during the treatment process can also restrict to make lifespan longer.', 'In addition, Singapore focuses more on developing its tertiary industry which are mainly consisting of services.', 'The governments are seeking solutions to solve this problem.', 'It would be great if life expectancies keep rising up day by day, but in reality, it does not seem to be so easy.', 'In addition, for observation journeys and traveling, we only need to use RFID on some certain individuals and they will agree with this action for their own benefit.', 'For example, there are always news on newspaper, report that some elderly get lost at certain place and their family are looking for him or her.', 'Around people, there are full of high technology like CCTVs, automatically sorting system for goods and different information systems.', 'Without a doubt, the rising life expectancy is definitely a success in human history as it shows the achievements of the medical industries in finding out ways and medicines to treat diseases that were thought to be incurable in the past and providing people with vaccines to prevent diseases.', 'Internet can be a convenient source to achieve the name and basic information of personal if it is hacked and the tracking proposal will facilitate the finding of designated person.', 'Subsequently, a lot of problems regarding to it are arising.', 'In other words, government originally hopes to use tracking system to ensure citizens safety, now it has been divulged human information.', 'People with rising life expectancies can ensure large population and large species of human being.', 'And also the over crowded modern cities also raise problem of public transportations, unevenly distributed wealth and education resources shortage also are the problems that some countries that may face to.', 'Because that the birth rate is reduced while the death rate is also reduced, the percentage of the elderly is increased while that of the youth is decreased.', 'It is well-known statistics that, generally, as a country develops the life expectancies increases.', 'They will be more vulnerable to be hurt or get some injures.', 'Without the using of the surveillance, the epidemic situation could not be controlled strictly, and the loss caused by SARS might be many times than that in 2003 in Singapore.', 'Then try to invent new energy and legitimately control population birth rate, then developing the medical treatment and paying enough attention, we have reasons to trust, population aging will not be problem at all.', 'Some socialists argue that installing surveillance device on people offends human rights and should be totally abandoned.', 'Actually, not only for scientific observations but also during adventure journeys or travelling, RFID can defend human beings from harm.', 'In the first place, it must have grasped advanced health care system.', 'In another word, there are more elders who have lower productivity and more medical problems compare to younger people in this world population.', 'If the old people always bring an auto-tracking device, it is much easier for the younger people to find them and it helps to guard the safety of the old people.', 'Rising life expectancies can be considered both a challenge and an achievement.', 'They may die for hunger, die from illness or just went to bed as usual but never waked again.', 'In China, lots of families only have one child.', 'The high accuracy in utilizing surveillance technology eliminates the amount of disagreements among people.', 'Therefore, the patient will have a bigger chance to be cured and survive.', 'In countries like Singapore, manpower is the only natural resources available which Singapore can invest on as she does not have enough lands to build farms and factories.', 'When mentioning about the population ageing, media always consider it as a social problem.', 'Therefore, some measurement and education about this should be taken by the government and the surrounding people to ensure the security of the old people.', 'On the other hand, rising life expectancies could bring some achievements.', 'In front of ATM we need monitor to avoid intentional crime.', 'Government should help encourage the breakthroughs as well as complete medication system.', 'My life now is exposed to lots of CCTV.', 'For example, making ordinary people not allowed to use that and do not let the surveillance device accessible to the ordinary people so that abuse usage of surveillance technology can be avoided, which is also a effective way to protect human right.', 'Firstly, security systems are improved in many areas such as school campus or at the workplace.', 'There is no a doubt, tracking system has brought many benefits in this information age.', 'It is responsibility of government to ensure the living of old people.', 'An improvement in engineering and medical science had been valued since humanism arises.', 'The leakage of these confidential information can be a sensitive issue to personal, violation of freedom and breakdown of safety.', 'For example, this can be a very beneficial and useful device for police force to track crime suspects and terrorists for their movements, or contributing to more leads for solving a case.', 'Therefore, achieving such great fret, in these areas is considered as an achievement where human lives is then improved and extended the life of us.', 'Rising life expectancies can be a pro to family affairs.', 'By RFID, the customer who is potential to buy a very expensive luxury will be less reluctant to consider what if it lost, because the RFID can help them get it back.', 'Therefore, we must encounter the challenges and be proud of the achievement to create a new life for our next generation.', 'With a doubled life time, humans can have change to explore the real meaning of life.', 'However, if the child has been installed with tracking device, more information will be provided along the way when the family is trying to find him or her back.', 'Increasing size of population also leads to the problem in food supply.', 'One can also easily see his deeply loved one through internet from miles away.', 'However, this rising life expectancies have become a challenge and also and an achievement in the population ageing.', 'Children can easily be track based on the location of cell phone by parents.', 'However, the world is always beyond our imagination and never let us down.', '\" The weak is meat and the strong eat it \" does not apply nowadays.', 'On the other hand, the application of surveillance technology serves as a warning to the murders and they might not commit more murder since they might be afraid of being tracked by the police.', \"As the technology increasingly advances, many of things that are regarded as impossible are turning into the 'possibles'.\", 'In the following, I will take Singapore as the case study as a reference to my discussion.', 'In the ancient times, the residents may only live for 30 years; but now, the life expectancy can be 80s in many countries.', 'In fact, people are getting more exposed in public through the fast development of the virtual world-the internet.', 'In economic, we can use GDP to explain the challenge, if GDP is low, it shows that most of people are living in a hard life, life quality is bad, then it will cause the terrible society problem, at last, it will happen the society disturbance.', 'With the moral of filial, most of the children will take care of their parents after their retirement life.', 'When mentioning about the population ageing, media always consider it as a social problem.', 'Does the implanting chip definitely safe and feasible?', 'To take care of old people, facillities such as nursing homes should be built, which add on to the expense of society.', 'In this, I mean that we can input this device implant into an animal or birds species, for us to track their movements and actions relating to our human research that can bring us to a new regime.', \"This survey evidently shows that big achievement has been made in the medical area and people's living standard has been improved.\", 'Another aspect would be that as the young people feel it is hard to feed the old people in their families and themselves, they would choose not to give birth to any child in order to reduce the burdens on themselves.', \"As we know that population of human continues in growth year by year, we are using the non-recoverable natural resources in everyday life, for example, the oil, people's life and technology improvement are not able to continue without the usage of oil.\", \"It represents a query: is not everyone can view each other's information such as name and age?\", 'No matter which reason stated above exactly dominant to the rising of life expectancies it is one of the evidence of the achievement of human nation.', 'In the first place, every civilized person more or less dislikes the idea that he or she is being close watched every second.', 'However, as there are only limited space and resource on earth, rising life expectancy is also a challenge for all the people worldwide.', 'However, while we are enjoying the fruits carried be the development of the economy, we are also facing a global problem --- population ageing.', 'The rising life expectancies are like a two side sword to the modern world.', 'Compared to the human implant, tags on the products is better and more suitable.', 'Government will be burdened by the growing aging population as well because it needs to set aside a great amount of money to provide better welfare of the old people because they are in urgent need of it.', 'Instead, when news of the installment of such device was released on the newspaper, it was heavily cricised by the public.', 'Population ageing means that there are more retired old people in the society and the portion of working adults is decreased.', 'In short, it can provide a safe, convenient, identifiable environment for human beings.', 'On the other hand, the aging of Population can also be a challenge to the society.', \"This survey evidently shows that big achievement has been made in the medical area and people's living standard has been improved.\", 'Observers are likely to go into the rural forests or mountainous areas.', 'Avoiding corruption and separating power is more important than forbidding surveillance technology.', 'The increasing pressure will lead to the declining fertility.', 'Therefore, the surveillance technology should not be used except for some specific jobs.', 'In conclusion, RFID benefited people more than brought harmful side effect to human body by considering for human safety.', 'In that sense, rising life expectancies can be considered as an achievement.', 'What should be concerned is how it can be applied in the right area in a right way.', 'In last two centuries, we human have made the greatest achievement in developing our society.', 'Illustrations that is both hypothetical and yet concrete are action spy movies, such as the Bourne identity.', 'Moreover, as we use up more and more resources, what we have left may not enough for us to live on if we do not have enough human resource to do research of developing new technology.', 'Since no one knew about this disease before, it spread around the whole world before human taking action.', 'Today, the surveillance technology has become almost manifest to wherever we go.', 'We all know that there is an application on iphone called where is my iphone.', 'We all know that there is an application on iphone called where is my iphone.', 'Then, if a business man wants to defeat his competitor, he can just buy a reader and spy for commercial secrets.', 'Imagine when people camping in forest or hills, they will just lost all of the internet signal and also a risk that their phone running out of batteries.', 'In the ancient time, due to the less development of science and technology, people had less medicine or medical equipment and took less care for their healthy.', 'The condition of the living environment is also improved that people are able to live in more hyginenic places.', 'Ageing population requires more medical sources since elders needs more medical attention.', 'More facilities and service will be needed to fulfill these requirements.', 'At the same time, people must protect their privacy without share their place to strangers.', 'The rising life expectancies can be considered an achievement and a challenge because it is the by-product of rising quality of life; bringing along its glory and its dirty little secrets.', 'We should image that when the life expectancies are raised up; this will mean that the average age for the population in nation wise or globally is also rising.', \"Indeed, thanks to improved living standard and medical care, countless people's lives are extended.\", 'Since that we have a better living circumstances and higher living quality, we are leading a longer life.', \"In the movie, the spy agent accesses the public street cameras to track Jason's Borne whereabouts.\", 'As we can use the resources with maximum efficiency, we can enjoy more and more life material than any time of human society.', 'What is more, RFID can be used to help collect demographic data.', 'Before robots can fully replace labor, the decreasing of generating power indicate less creativity and less goods available for us to use.', 'Apart from diseases themselves, deficiency of medication system coverage and inefficiency during the treatment process can also restrict to make lifespan longer.', 'Also, not only the kidnappers and the victim need to be tracked down, but also jailbreakers.', 'If the individual or family is to pay the bill, they can be bankrupted because of illness.', 'However, disadvantages have also been gradually disappeared as with the fruits people are enjoying.', 'Surveillance technology such as Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) to track the population is potentially is dangerous weapon by the governments against its own people.', 'Therefore, we need to continue on our striving as try our best to reduce the adverse impact that is carried.', \"With the installing of the surveillances for every corner of Singapore, people's life has a safe security, and criminals are deterred by these electrical instruments.\", 'Instead, owing to CCTV, telephone and other RFID, we are becoming characters in a play watched by someone, but we seldom notice it, that is why it is horrible to our life.', \"Fewer famines, better sanitations and more access to healthcare in developing countries will be this century's greatest achievement as a global society.\", 'An improvement in engineering and medical science had been valued since humanism arises.', 'When I work, it seems I am holding my heart working since if I am doing something wrong or relax in working time.', 'This is more than convenient for the authority to take better control of the society down to every individual.', 'There was a saying which says that hunger can bring people back to animals.', 'With more advanced technology in medicine area, more and more diseases can be cured so that much more death is avoided.', 'In addition, now there appears a contradiction if rising life expectancies, it will lead a resources problem.', 'Con, on the other hand, in terms of tangible aspect mainly in the economic drive and desire of the nation for the sustainability of their economic position and reputation in the world.', 'Nevertheless, provision of more medicine and better equipments as well as more medical centre is necessary to accommodate these elders.', 'Without such surveillance technology, we can still live a better future.', 'However, there are situations where we have to consider the rising life expectancy as a challenge and an achievement.', 'Although the initial function of implementation of RFID is good for the children, however children also have the human rights and privacy which is endanger under this technology.', 'However, as the energy and resources use up, more and more adult people without sufficient power to produce crowd on earth will aggravate the ageing problem, so the rise of life expectancies can also be seen as a challenge.', 'It is a natural rule that when people grow older, their bodies will be less flexible and brains will operate slower, so they will contribute less to the society.', \"We should respect that everyone has human rights and without other's permission, this should not be placed or implanted to anyone.\", 'Close surveillance is not only a problem of bad feelings, but also a problem of the health of the society.', 'Since not all of the human being is going to be a doctor, people relies the skills of treatment of doctors and hence, they start to ignore the maintenance of their own health.', 'So according to the humanism, people should make contribution to rising the humans life, because people should consider the feelings if one day when you are becoming older and older, so respecting life should be considered carefully.', 'The observation means that the more developed the countries, the longer the life span of citizens.', 'With a doubled life time, humans can have change to explore the real meaning of life.', 'For developing countries, they may encounter more about the shortage of food resources and and the problem of how to develop better medication system to serve the entire nation, and they also face the problem of how to distribute the wealth evenly to benefit the entire population, more over they need to consider carefully how to build the education system so that the next generation of the population will be able to carry on to raise the whole country.', 'In an aged population, low spending affects the economic growth.', 'The first example will be to track your personal items and prevent from losing it.', 'A worse thing is that one may not even be aware of that he or she is being tracked.', 'Moreover, the money spend on telephone call record is $1.8 million per year.', 'There are also medical tools that are more of implant into the human body for the basic medical research.', 'However, it is fairly fragile which can be counter-used by criminals at current level.', 'Does the implanting chip definitely safe and feasible?', 'Ageing population requires more medical sources since elders needs more medical attention.', 'Statisticians can use these data to build up appropriate models to predict the future needs for each city so that local governments know where and when to build more infrastructures, what kind of infrastructures and what other development should be made.', 'Moreover, the life expectancies have also been raised due to the developing of the economy.', 'There is only one thing different.', 'In that sense, without a proper way to track human being, it is way too difficult to save those innocent life.', 'However, when we look at the brighter side of the reality, the rise in life expectancy proves great improvements in various realms and solved many problems we had in the past, there is hope that the aging population may transform into helpful force to a country in the future with the help of better technology and medication.', 'Not only has the family member of the old people, but also the government needed to spend a lot of effort to handle such situation.', 'Perhaps that the surveillance is installed for the sake of safety, but actually it conversely make us have a lack of safety.', 'However, tracking people are difficult and different from goods.', 'Leasing of private information, even though it only happened one time, but one is too many for an individual.', 'At the same time more people are needed to take care of the old ones, which gives the younger generation extra works.', 'If a society has the most advanced medical science and the best environment, but do not grant the access to them to its senior citizens, it just does not help.', 'It is remarkable that population aged 60 and over is increasing at 2% to 3% annually in developing countries as well.', 'As technology becomes more advanced nowadays, people are very exposed to the various types of technology in their daily lives.', 'Not only has the family member of the old people, but also the government needed to spend a lot of effort to handle such situation.', 'A possible benefit is better statistical analysis, which will provide the government with more information when drafting policies.', 'All passengers and pilots were died.', 'With proper use of surveillance technology, surveillance technology can be a good tool for the police, and also benefit all the society.', 'We cannot imagine our every move is under track and there may be someone who is staring at you from some place through the monitor.', 'These two words can be seen from various media and assessments of this social trend are of great number.', 'We revealed our locations, for our friends to catch up with us, however we can never know who is watching us out there secretly.', 'For the young people, parents do not need to worry about where my kids will go after the school.', 'Firstly, knowing where the travelers are and may going can assist them to know what the surroundings will be like and they can prepare better to protect themselves or they can change directions to avoid the potential danger.', 'This is more than convenient for the authority to take better control of the society down to every individual.', 'The concurrent result is increasing size of population.', 'They do not want to bother to spend so much time in raising and nurturing children.', 'After a country was just founded, some immature policy leaded to a nationwide hunger.', \"However, as the technology develops, it increased people's mobility and productivity so as life expectancies.\", 'The increase in population means the larger the natural resources are needed and people have to think out some idea like to prevent using too much natural resources.', 'Rising life expectancies is also an evidence of progress of modern medical technology.', \"Obviously, rising of life expectancies is a mark of our achievements in terms of hospitalizing technology, insurance condition, culture development, and our social system, which shows the improvements of people's life quality.\", 'Obviously, rising life expectancies should also be considered as a serious challenge.', 'Disabled people walks with artificial legs, man can getting pregnant, even the sexual of a human can be changed just by doing simple surgery.', 'Thirdly, compared to the young people, the security of the elderly is more notable.', 'Before robots can fully replace labor, the decreasing of generating power indicate less creativity and less goods available for us to use.', 'If a country can bear a ageing population, it is a thing that the country can be proud of.', 'There has been a report estimated that at the year 2060, only half of

and an achievement because it means the increase of the load and the advance of society, including at least advaced advanced health care system, reduced hazards from the environment and the ubiquitous good will for senior citizens, at the same time.', 'Such situation is a major progress from the ancient time and also a big achievement by all human beings.', 'They do not want to bother to spend so much time in raising and nurturing children.', 'Average life span rise from 45 years old in 1920s to over 65 years old in 2010s.', 'First, the medical cost will rise greatly.', 'If anyone has ever read any fiction or storied written before the 18th century, it is very hard to find any character in those stories lived longer than 80 years old.', 'They may die for hunger, die from illness or just went to bed as usual but never waked again.', \"In the reality, people are afraid of being tracking everywhere, not because of meaning to crime, but the spirit of freedom and privacy is in everyone's heart.\", 'Having power can help people to achieve lots of things; however, abusing will guide us to another direction.', 'In another words, it indicates that the national healthcare system is effective, well-managed by the Government.', 'There is one thing is common in the world described in many fiction - chips are implanted in human and records its location, history and even thoughts at that time.', 'With the existing of experience, we can do the work more quickly without sacrifice the standard and quality.', 'Since no one knew about this disease before, it spread around the whole world before human taking action.', 'So, the mark for how long is the life expectancy is indicating how well people is living.', 'Another rising life expectancy is a bigger house with a lower price which is raised up by younger generation.', 'Afterall there will be an endless battle between the technology and human mentality.', 'Without the using of the surveillance, the epidemic situation could not be controlled strictly, and the loss caused by SARS might be many times than that in 2003 in Singapore.', 'In this mean time, surveillance technology is founded which mean that we are able to track people at every time in everywhere.', 'Thus, we should not compare now with the past but we need to worried about the future problems that caused by this situation.', \"Without sending back any images or sound record, RFID is more user-friendly and helps prevent user's privacy at the best it can.\", 'Thus, I strongly agree that surveillance technology such as RFID (radio-frequency identification) can be used to track people.', 'All these technology advancement also helps to improve the lives of human race in terms of improving the lifestyle, environment and medical ability.', 'Since the inventory management is very important for some kind of companies, this technology is playing a very significant role.', 'This is very hazardous.', 'The ability to eliminate the illness is considered as an achievement as this proves that the ability of the human race to research and develop the medical ability to solve and eliminated the harm that is able to take the life of a human away at a earlier age.', 'In the first place, it must have grasped advanced health care system.', 'We often put tags on products and animals because we treat them as goods, it is easy for trade when they are all labelled and tagged.', 'Surveillance technology such as Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) to track the population is potentially is dangerous weapon by the governments against its own people.', 'Their purchasing power is low.', 'The police seize the criminal thanks to CCTV.', 'On one hand, if there are less young people and more old people, lacking work force problem will arise.', 'To take care of old people, facillities such as nursing homes should be built, which add on to the expense of society.', 'In modern world, many global issues have been appeared like global warming, concept of earth village and population.', 'Ageing problem is in essence a problem of worsening bodies.', 'This ability is not seen 40 years back where the technology advances were not as good as now.', 'However, disadvantages have also been gradually disappeared as with the fruits people are enjoying.', 'Everyday crimes are happening from time to time, and help to keep low criminal rate can be a combo of ethical, physiological and social problems.', 'This would result in decrease in birth rate of a country which is a very serious problem,especially in more developed countries as the population has already reached a minimum.', 'Yet, do not be confused by this superficial amount and achievement.', 'If there are more young people, then there will be even more elderly with rising life expectancies in the future definitely.', \"On the other hand, due to the track of people, the police can better know a person's daily schedule.\", 'If anyone has ever read any fiction or storied written before the 18th century, it is very hard to find any character in those stories lived longer than 80 years old.', 'It gives you the feeling that all people are watching a movie, and you are the hero whose every movement including using the toilet is under others observation, just like what was showed in the movie The Truman Show which chronicles the life of a man who is initially unaware that he is living in a constructed world, broadcast to billions of people.', 'While as it becomes highly developed, it is very scary to realize that this technology actually tells lots of people where did you go and what did you do.', 'The concurrent result is increasing size of population.', 'Rising life expectancies can be considered both a challenge and an achievement.', 'For this part, not only the privacy problem is concerned, but the human health.', 'Not long from now SARS, as blurry as it is, attacked people all around the world.', \"Some people may argue that using RFID to track people will leave out individuals' privacy.\", 'The modification was so obvious that people can easily recognize.', 'Life expectancy is a figure that reveals the average lifetime and can be used as an indicator to measure up to what degree is the population ageing problem.', 'The problem of abuse of surveillance is only the problem of abuse of power.', 'Rising life expectancies can be a pro to family affairs.', 'However, when it happens, it is hard to deny that it brings problems such as increased expenses and reduced labors to the society.', 'To extend our life is not only a symbol of our achievement in developing our society, but also a fulfillment of our original dream.', 'If the current quality of life has to be sustained or increase in order to keep increasing the life expectancies, it will be continue to have a huge impact on the environment.', 'If the above two aspects are described as the hardwares of the system, they do require a software to function, which is the ubiquitous good will for senior citizens.', 'Since not all of the human being is going to be a doctor, people relies the skills of treatment of doctors and hence, they start to ignore the maintenance of their own health.', 'There are also medical tools that are more of implant into the human body for the basic medical research.', 'These statistical analyses will give governments more accurate information when drafting policies.', 'Perhaps that the surveillance is installed for the sake of safety, but actually it conversely make us have a lack of safety.', 'Overall, the benefit of these technologies overweight its problems occurred if people use it wisely.', \"But tracking people is very terrible choice, it sounds like people invented a 'prison' to jail themselves, people need homage and freedom.\", 'Not only has the family member of the old people, but also the government needed to spend a lot of effort to handle such situation.', 'It also indicates that the foods the people eat are nourishing and can decrease the amount of illness that can cause death, thus living longer.', 'Rising life expectancies can be a challenge.', 'Typically, the RFID tags are small devices with a read-only chip.', \"And once this happens, privacy does not exist any more and people's life is under great threaten.\", 'By getting the track of the suspensors, police officers can decide who the criminal exactly is sooner and easier to gain the truth behind the criminal event.', 'Medical advances which help in curing this illness were also getting better over the year which helps in the rise in life expectancy.', 'Not Being Imprisoned by Surveillance Technology', \"The production of food is showing a lower growth rate compare to population's growth rate which will end up with insufficient food in the future.\", \"As the technology increasingly advances, many of things that are regarded as impossible are turning into the 'possibles'.\", 'Hence, the rising life expectancies no doubt can be considered as a great achievement.', 'In this mean time, surveillance technology is founded which mean that we are able to track people at every time in everywhere.', 'In general trend, elderly people are easy to be ill as compared to young capable adults.', 'Projections of the United Nations indicate that the population aged 60 or over in developed and developing countries is increasing at 2% to 3% annually.', 'As the RFID is embedded within the product, people who have the access to the information definitely can track him.', 'The technology is based on the chip implant or tag.', 'Technology can be a very useful tool if being used in the correct manner.', 'Nevertheless, human still need an improvement.', 'There are kidnaps everywhere and not all of the family can afford the ransom that acquired by kidnappers.', 'Rising life expectancy is a technology achievement.', 'He or she could easily touch on the designated bank account since password cracking is an easy task for most hackers.', 'The technology also applies.', 'In addition, it is also a challenge for government, family and parents to educate their children about the moral of filial.', 'Close surveillance is not only a problem of bad feelings, but also a problem of the health of the society.', 'During scientific exploration, especially the geographical ones, the tracking is very important.', 'In conclusion, the increase in population age shows both the human technology achievement and the new challenges like lack of young generation.', 'There are kidnaps everywhere and not all of the family can afford the ransom that acquired by kidnappers.', 'If RFID is used on everyone and running for years, surveillance centre will have a complete set of statistic data showing the movement of people from city to city, from town to town, which city is expanding more than people thought, which city is becoming less attractive.', 'This tracking proposal creates a loophole in the net of justice rather than its original purpose.', 'Now people not only can have food to survive but also enjoy high-level food and even pursuing the tasty and luxury one.', 'Beside, if RFID is supposed to be use by the public, everyone will be able to locate their friends and also their dearest family.', 'Much more could be done to reach the stage of extending the lifespan of human being.', 'The person in the record had been changed with another one before it was released to the public.', 'Take Singapore for example, these are installed from highly secured places such as Government sectors to working places, from condominiums to housing development board houses, and even from school canteens to toilets!', 'For people, this is an achievement, but for nature, it changes its rule and cycle, which is a big challenge faced by human being.', 'These changes and damages also increase the chances of contacting more illness as we age.', 'Subsequently, a lot of problems regarding to it are arising.', 'However, ageing population will also increase many kinds of other expenditure.', 'Moreover, as we use up more and more resources, what we have left may not enough for us to live on if we do not have enough human resource to do research of developing new technology.', 'For developing countries, they may encounter more about the shortage of food resources and and the problem of how to develop better medication system to serve the entire nation, and they also face the problem of how to distribute the wealth evenly to benefit the entire population, more over they need to consider carefully how to build the education system so that the next generation of the population will be able to carry on to raise the whole country.', 'It can cause many problems but it also means a lot for the human beings.', \"This technology are encouraged by some of the public that to implant the RFID into prisoners' body.\", 'It is the outcomes of advance medical technology, changing of lifestyle and higher living standard.', \"However, some of the non-governmental organizations show their point of view that object and resist implanting the RFID into prisoners' body.\", 'Third, to use the surveillance technology will enhance the totalitarian power of the authority.', 'In the long history of the evolution, we are always struggling for life against staving and illness.', 'However, as there are only limited space and resource on earth, rising life expectancy is also a challenge for all the people worldwide.', 'Would not it similar to criminals in prison but in a bigger confined space?', \"For example, it could be installed in personal lockers to record other's moves and actions.\", 'There are a series of diseases that hinders longevity.', \"These small things makes the quality of people's life less enjoyable than today.\", 'Therefore, human need to appreciate the longer life span and consider it as an achievement.', 'Although rising of life expectancies is an challenge to the entire human nation, the detailed problems each country that will encounter is different.', 'Instead, owing to CCTV, telephone and other RFID, we are becoming characters in a play watched by someone, but we seldom notice it, that is why it is horrible to our life.', 'In addition, old people are weakened in many aspects, thus they are usually not considered as labors.']\n"
